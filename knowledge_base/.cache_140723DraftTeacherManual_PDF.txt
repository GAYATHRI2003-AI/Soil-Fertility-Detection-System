TEACHER'S MANUAL FOR SOIL
HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROGRAMAbout the Document
Soil is a crucial and necessary foundation for plant growth and is a supremely
important resource for our country. More than 54% of our workforce either directly
depends on agriculture for their livelihood, or through allied activities. Therefore, the
health of soil affects more than 54% of our workforce! Soil health is fundamental to the
food system in the country. It forms the bedrock of agriculture and serves as the vital
medium for the growth of food-producing plants. When soils are healthy, they yield
higher productivity of nutritious crops that provide nourishment for both humans and
animals. It's important to recognize that the quality and quantity of our food are directly
connected to the quality of our soils. Therefore, prioritising soil health is essential for
ensuring the availability of high-quality and abundant food for all and reducing
dependency on other countries for agricultural produce.
The Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasised the importance of
teaching students the importance of soil and its health. He has also called for senior
secondary students to be trained and involved in doing soil tests to support farmers to
the extent possible. This would be done by utilising school laboratories.
In light of this, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the Ministry of
Education, the Central Board of Secondary Education have partnered to create and
curate this resource for students and teachers to be apprised of the importance of soil
health and testing.
This document provides teachers with information about soil, its importance in our
society, its various functions and types, along with the significance of teaching
students about soil health. This document aims to equip teachers with the knowledge
about soil health and measures to improve it such that they may impart it to their
students and support the efforts of soil testing to help our nation's farmers.Contents

Health Card program in school labs and highlights the significance of soil
health, the current situation of soil erosion and desertification, and the
outcomes of the program.
• The poster highlights the objective and need of the Soil Health Card program
in school labs. The objective of this program is to encourage hands-on scientific
enquiry on soil parameters such as nutrient content, soil pH, and organic
matter. By studying these aspects of soil, we can learn more about how to
cultivate it in a better way. It also helps us to develop a sense of responsibility
towards sustainable agricultural practices and builds environmental awareness
among us.
• The poster also highlights the importance of soil health. Healthy soil is a finite
and precious resource that takes centuries to develop. It plays a critical role in
sustainable food production. Without healthy soil, it would be difficult to grow
the crops we rely on for our food. In addition, soil provides us with environmental
benefits like biodiversity and carbon storage, which are essential for a balanced
ecosystem.
• Explain the current situation of soil erosion and soil desertification in our country
is a matter of concern. Around 30% of India's geographical area is affected by
degradation, and 29.32% is undergoing desertification. Share the statistics
given in the poster and indicate the students that we need to take immediate
action to protect and improve our soil.
• After this discussion, share the expected outcomes of the Soil Health Card
program. Explain to the students that when they learn more about soil health,
they can promote deeper agricultural knowledge and can make informed
decisions on how to take care of our soil. This program will help us develop a
sense of environmental stewardship amongst students, which means taking
responsibility for protecting and conserving our natural resources. By building
a greener and more sustainable future, we can ensure that our planet thrives.
In conclusion, the poster must be leveraged to motivate and inspire students to
become "soil heroes" and care for the planet.
2Poster 2 - Soil & Agriculture in India
3• The poster provides students valuable information about the significance of soil
and agriculture in our country. It is important to discuss the statistics given in
the poster highlighting the extensive agricultural activity taking place in our
country.
• The chart shows us the distribution of farm holdings among individuals. The
majority, approximately 68.45%, fall under the category of marginal holdings,
which means they own up to 1 hectare of land. Around 17.62% fall under small
holdings, owning 1-2 hectares of land. The remaining 13.93% fall into the
category of others, who own more than 2 hectares of land. With this information,
students can recognise the different types of farm holdings in India.
• The poster draws attention to the presence of chemicals in the food chain
highlighting the need to reduce chemical usage in agriculture for healthier food
production. Through the poster we can reiterate the importance of exploring
sustainable and organic farming practices to ensure the safety of our food.
• Moving on, the poster also discusses the global condition of soil erosion and
desertification in comparison to India's context. The significant challenges that
these issues pose on food production must be addressed with students to make
them aware of how crucial it is to protect our soil and combat erosion and
desertification.
• The poster also highlights the contribution of agriculture to our GDP. The
agriculture sector employs over 50% of the total workforce in India,
demonstrating its importance in providing livelihoods. Furthermore, agriculture
contributes around 20% of our country's Gross Domestic Product value. This
shows how agriculture plays a vital role in our economy.
• The next point mentioned is about India's agro-climatic conditions. The country
is divided into 15 broad agro-climatic zones based on factors such as
physiography, soils, geological formation, climate, and cropping patterns.
These zones help in planning agricultural activities and developing future
strategies to optimize agricultural productivity.
• Discuss the major food grains and cereals produced in our country. It
showcases categories such as rice, wheat, nutri/coarse cereals, maize, barley,
pulses (such as gram and moong), and oilseeds (including groundnut, soybean,
and rapeseed & mustard). These food items are essential for our sustenance
and play a vital role in our diet. This discussion will also further strengthen the
student’s understanding of the importance of soil and agriculture in our country.
4Poster 3 - Soil health card
5• The poster is to help students know more about the Soil Health Card (SHC)
program and its objective of promoting Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)
for improving soil health and productivity.
• The program aims to improve soil health and productivity through the judicious
use of chemical fertilizers, organic manures, and biofertilizers. Integrated
Nutrient Management (INM) is the approach used to achieve this goal. INM
emphasizes the balanced and efficient use of nutrients to ensure sustainable
agriculture.
• The sub-components of the SHC scheme are also mentioned in the poster.
These include setting up or strengthening Soil Testing Labs, Quality Control
Labs for fertilizers, bio-fertilizers, and organic fertilizers. It is important to create
awareness about this as the labs play a crucial role in analysing soil samples
and providing farmers with essential information about their soil's nutrient status
and recommended nutrient dosage. This helps farmers make informed
decisions regarding fertilizers and other inputs.
• The objectives of implementing INM and promoting soil health are then
explained. Here teachers can discuss with students how adopting INM
practices, farmers can achieve higher yields while maintaining the long-term
health of their land and the soil structure, nutrient holding capacity, and water-
holding capacity can also be simultaneously improved.
• Furthermore, the poster highlights the importance of minimizing environmental
pollution caused by excess fertilizer use. Here, the students must be made
aware of other components of INM such as organic manures and biofertilizers.
These natural inputs enrich the soil, improve its fertility, and promote a healthy
and sustainable farming system.
• The message on the poster, "Let us join hands to support every farmer," is a
call for collective action for students. It emphasizes the importance of
supporting our farmers in their efforts to improve soil health and productivity.
6Poster 4: Learning together with Farmers
7• It is important to discuss this poster with students as it emphasizes the
importance of schools and students in supporting local farmers and promoting
sustainable agriculture practices. It is important for students to understand their
role in supporting local farmers.
• The poster highlights that students can make a significant difference by actively
engaging in activities that promote and understand sustainable agriculture
practices. They can do so by participating in hands-on activities like community
kitchen gardens and fields. Teachers can ensure that by getting involved in
these activities, they not only learn about food production but also experience
the joy of growing our own food. This will help in developing a deeper
appreciation for the effort and hard work that goes into producing the food we
consume.
• The poster also encourages us to organize farm visits. These visits allow them
to connect with farmers and gain a better understanding of the challenges they
face in agriculture. It will also foster respect and empathy towards their
profession while creating a strong bond between students and farmers.
• Another way we can support local farmers is by promoting farmer markets.
These markets provide a platform for farmers to directly sell their produce to
the community. By purchasing fresh, locally grown produce from these markets,
we not only support the farmers financially but also benefit from healthier and
more sustainable food options.
• The poster also includes infographics and pictures that demonstrate the
process of soil testing. These visuals will help students understand how soil
testing is done and its importance in ensuring healthy crop growth. With this
information they can help farmers make informed decisions regarding fertilizers
and other inputs.
In conclusion, the poster highlights the need for collective effort and promotes
sustainable agriculture practices to contribute to a stronger and more resilient
agricultural sector.
8Poster 5 - Type of Soils
9• The poster provides valuable information about the various types of soil found
in India and their association with specific regions and natural vegetation. Each
type of soil is found in specific regions of the country and has distinct
characteristics. By studying soil types and their characteristics, students can
also learn how to adapt our farming practices accordingly.
• Different types of soil require different approaches for sustainable agriculture
and land management. This knowledge is important for farmers, policymakers,
and environmentalists to make informed decisions and preserve the fertility and
health of our soil.
• By making students understand and appreciate the diversity of soil types,
teachers can discuss how they can contribute to sustainable land management
practices and ensure the long-term productivity and health of our soil. Students
can be encouraged to learn more about the soil and vegetation present in their
respective regions.
10Chapter 2: Introduction to Soil
What is Soil & its Composition?
Soil is a mixture of minerals and organic material that covers much of Earth’s
surface. Minerals are bits of rock, and organic material is the remains of living things
that have died. Soil provides the structural support to plants for growing crops under
agriculture lands and is their source of water and nutrients. Soils varies in their
chemical and physical properties. Processes such as leaching, weathering and
microbial activity combine to make a whole range of different soil types.
Composition of soil:
The arrangement and distribution of soil components vary as per soil types. There are
mainly four types of soil:
11Twelve major soil texture
classifications are defined
by the United States,
Department of Agriculture
as shown alongside –
Percent proportions of sand,
silt and clay will determine
the type of textural classes.
Importance of Soils to Agriculture
• Agriculture is one of the most important economic components of our society.
• Soil being finite in nature and precious resource for agriculture as it provides
the structural support to crops in agriculture and is also their source of water
and nutrients in nearly 45.27% percent of reported geographic area under
agriculture in the country (140 million ha) in the country.
• India hugely depends on agriculture for its economy which support livelihood of
50% population.
• Agriculture sector employs over 50% of the total workforce in the country and
Responsible for 20% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product Value.
• Healthy soil plays a critical in successful agriculture in terms of providing foods;
fodder with environmental benefits of biodiversity and carbon storage required
for effective functioning of ecosystem services and is the original source of the
nutrients that we use to grow crops
12• Soil being finite in nature and requires 200-400 years to develop 1cm of soil
layer. Only healthy soil Provide medium for plants use soil nutrients, and when
they die, microorganisms decompose their remains. Thus, soil provide base for
nutrients cycle to operate effectively
• The healthiest soils produce the healthiest and most abundant food supplies,
so for getting unabated food supply without compromising soil health,
monitoring of soil health is present day reality.
In nature, plants use soil nutrients, and then they die and are decomposed by
microorganisms. This returns the nutrients to the soil.
13Chapter 3: Issues of Soil Health
Basics of Soil health
Soil health corresponds to the state of the soil being in sound physical, chemical, and
biological condition, having the capability to sustain the growth and development of land
plants. It is the sustained ability of soil to produce crops and supply, retention and
infiltration of water, habitat for diverse organisms, and recycling of nutrients. In the
recent past, soil health is continuing to gain importance among farmers, scientists and
planners world over for implementation of programs on sustainable agriculture
development. While awareness of soil health is increasing, it is important to have a
good understanding of what soil health, how it is measured, and how to manage it for
optimal and sustainable delivery of the ecosystem services that soils provide.
Just as we can take different measurement to judge a person’s health, it is also possible
to measure specific soil properties to detect whether a soil is healthy or not. Such
measurements may be quantitative or qualitative, or a combination of both. In India
presently under Soil Health Card Scheme 12 parameters are measured. They are Soil
primary nutrients (N, P, K), Soil Secondary nutrients (S), Soil micronutrients (Zn, Fe,
CU, Mn, B), Soil salinity (EC), Soil pH and Soil Organic Carbon.
The critical situation of soil health status with respect to agriculture
14The critical situation of soil health status with respect to agriculture is a significant
concern worldwide. Here are some details regarding this issue:
1. Soil Degradation: Soil degradation is a primary concern affecting soil health. Factors
such as erosion, nutrient depletion, compaction, salinization, and acidification
contribute to the deterioration of soil quality. Unsustainable agricultural practices,
deforestation, urbanization, and climate change exacerbate these issues.
2. Nutrient Depletion: Continuous cultivation without adequate nutrient replenishment
can lead to nutrient depletion in the soil. Nutrients essential for plant growth, such as
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are gradually depleted, resulting in reduced
crop yields. Inadequate nutrient management, excessive use of synthetic fertilizers,
and poor organic matter management contribute to this problem.
3. Acidification and Salinization: When soil pH dropping below optimal levels for plant
growth. Acidification can result from excessive use of chemical fertilizers, acid rain etc.
Whereas salinization occurs when the salt content in the soil increases to harmful
levels due over-irrigation, poor drainage, and the use of low-quality water sources. It
reduces the availability of water to plants and negatively affects their growth and
productivity.
4. Loss of Organic Matter: Organic matter provides essential nutrients, improves soil
structure, and enhances moisture retention capacity. However, unsustainable farming
practices, including excessive tillage, removal of crop residues, and lack of organic
inputs, lead to a decline in organic matter content. Loss of organic matter reduces soil
fertility and resilience.
5. Pollution and Contamination: Agricultural activities often involve the use of
pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Improper application and excessive use of these
chemicals can result in soil pollution and contamination. Chemical residues in the soil
can harm soil organisms, beneficial insects, and potentially enter the food chain,
posing risks to human health and the environment.
15Addressing these critical issues requires implementing sustainable agricultural
practices, such as conservation tillage, crop rotation, agroforestry, cover cropping, and
precision agriculture. These practices aim to minimize soil erosion, promote nutrient
cycling, enhance soil structure, and reduce chemical inputs, thereby improving soil
health and ensuring long-term agricultural sustainability.
Present day challenges of Soil health and Fertility
Soil fertility is inherent ability of soils to provide nutrient to plants in available forms. It
is a fundamental aspect of soil health. Together significance of soil fertility and soil
health for sustainable agriculture lies in its ability to support resilient and productive
cropping systems while preserving natural resources. By focusing on soil fertility
farmer can improve soil health, and their crop yields, improve the nutritional quality of
their produce, reduce environmental impacts, and contribute to a more sustainable
and resilient food system.
Today, Soil health being compromised due following factors
The imbalance in the use of fertilizers
The use of fertilizers and its impact on Indian soils is a significant concern that affects
soil health and agricultural sustainability in following way.
1. Excessive Use of Chemical Fertilizers: In India, there has been a tendency towards
excessive and imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers, particularly nitrogen (N),
phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Farmers often apply fertilizers based on crop yield
targets without considering the soil's nutrient requirements for crop. This imbalanced
application leads to nutrient overdosing in the soil.
2. Nutrient Imbalance: The excessive use of chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen
and phosphorus, while neglecting other essential nutrients, causes nutrient
imbalances in the soil. Imbalances can result in deficiencies or toxicities of certain
nutrients, negatively affecting crop growth and yield. Over time, these imbalances lead
to soil degradation and reduced fertility.
3. Soil Degradation and Reduced Fertility: The imbalanced use of fertilizers contributes
to soil degradation and reduced fertility. Excessive nitrogen application can lead to
16nutrient leaching, as well as the loss of soil organic matter. Phosphorus overuse can
result in phosphorus fixation, making it less available to plants. These factors
collectively degrade soil quality, decrease nutrient-holding capacity, and reduce
overall soil fertility.
4. Environmental Impact: The excessive use of chemical fertilizers in India has
environmental consequences beyond soil degradation. Manufacturing and
transportation of fertilizers contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and
energy consumption. Furthermore, the pollution caused by nutrient runoff from
agricultural fields affects water quality and aquatic ecosystems, impacting biodiversity
and human health.
5. Addressing the imbalance in fertilizer use requires a shift towards balanced nutrient
management practices. This includes soil testing to determine nutrient requirements,
adopting site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) techniques, promoting organic
farming and the use of organic fertilizers.
Government policies, farmer education programs, and subsidies that promote
sustainable fertilizer use and awareness about nutrient management can play a crucial
role in mitigating the adverse impacts on Indian soils and fostering sustainable
agriculture.
Impact of Human interference on soil health
Human interference has a significant impact on soil health and can lead to various
forms of soil degradation. Here are some ways in which human activities affect soil:
1. Deforestation: Clearing forests for agriculture, urbanization, or urban planning
disrupts the natural ecosystem and exposes the soil to erosion. Tree roots help bind
the soil together, and their removal increases the risk of soil erosion, leading to loss of
topsoil and decreased fertility.
2. Unsustainable Agriculture Practices: Intensive and unsustainable agricultural
practices contribute to soil degradation. Excessive tillage, overuse of chemical
17fertilizers and pesticides, monocropping, and improper flood irrigation can lead to soil
erosion, nutrient depletion, compaction, and loss of organic matter.
3. Urbanization and Construction: Urban development involves clearing land,
compacting soil, and covering it with impermeable surfaces such as concrete and
asphalt. This reduces soil's ability to absorb and retain water, disrupts natural drainage
patterns, and reduces soil fertility.
4. Industrial Activities and Pollution: Industrial activities release pollutants into the
environment, including heavy metals, chemicals, and toxins. These pollutants can
contaminate the soil, making it unsuitable for agriculture. Industrial waste disposal,
improper handling of hazardous materials, and industrial accidents can lead to soil
pollution.
5. Improper Waste Disposal: Improper disposal of solid waste, including plastics,
heavy metals, and organic waste, can lead to soil pollution. Landfills and waste
disposal sites that are not properly designed and managed can contaminate the
surrounding soil, groundwater, and ecosystems.
6. Climate Change: Human-induced climate change, primarily through increased
greenhouse gas emissions, affects soil health. Rising temperatures, changes in
precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can intensify soil erosion, alter
nutrient cycles, and impact microbial activity in the soil.
To mitigate the negative impacts of human interference on soil, sustainable land
management practices need to be adopted. These include conservation agriculture,
agroforestry, organic farming, proper waste management, reforestation, erosion
control measures, and responsible land-use planning. Additionally, educating and
raising awareness among individuals, farmers, and industries about the importance of
soil conservation and sustainable practices can help preserve soil health for future
generations.
18Chapter 4: Soil fertility indicators and soil Health in agriculture
The soil fertility attributes or indicators are interconnected and their status in soils
positively and negatively impacts the functioning within the soil-plant system. They
collectively contribute to the overall health and productivity of the soil.
Understanding of these attributes are vital for sustainable agriculture, as they help
optimize nutrient availability, promote plant growth, and support environmental
stewardship. Soil health assessment incorporating these attributes enables farmers to
make informed decisions regarding soil management practices, nutrient application,
and crop rotation, ultimately contributing to sustainable agricultural systems.
Percent soil Organic Carbon:
• Organic carbon is a measure of the amount of organic matter present in the
soil. It originates from decomposed plant and animal residues.
• Organic carbon contributes to soil health by enhancing soil structure, water-
holding capacity, and nutrient cycling. It promotes beneficial microbial activity.
• Adequate organic carbon content is essential for supporting plant growth,
nutrient availability, and overall soil health.
Soil pH
• Soil pH is a measure of soil acidity or alkalinity. It influences nutrient availability
and microbial activity in the soil.
• Different plants have different pH preferences, and soil pH affects nutrient
solubility and uptake by plant roots.
• Maintaining the appropriate soil pH range for specific crops helps optimize
nutrient availability and prevents nutrient deficiencies or toxicities.
19Electrical Conductivity (EC)
• EC is a measure of the soil's ability to conduct electrical current and indicates
the concentration of soluble salts in the soil.
• High EC levels can indicate soil salinity, which can negatively impact plant
growth and restrict nutrient uptake.
• Monitoring EC helps in assessing soil salinity and determining appropriate
management practices, such as leaching to reduce salt accumulation.
Available Nutrients
• Soil nutrients, including macro- and micronutrients, are essential for plant
growth and development.
• Nutrient availability in the soil depends on factors such as organic matter
decomposition, pH, and nutrient cycling processes.
• Adequate nutrient levels are crucial for plant growth, productivity, and overall
crop quality.
• Soil testing and analysis help determine the levels of available nutrients,
enabling farmers to adjust fertilization practices and address nutrient
imbalances
There and major and micro nutrients based on its quantitative requirement are been
categorised and these are as under:
Major nutrients
a) Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen is essential for plant growth and plays a vital role in
protein synthesis, leaf development, and overall plant vigour. However,
excessive nitrogen use can lead to environmental issues such as water
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
20b) Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus is crucial for energy transfer, root development,
and fruiting in plants. Phosphorus availability in the soil supports healthy crop
establishment, enhances root growth, and improves crop quality.
c) Potassium (K): Potassium is involved in numerous physiological processes in
plants, including enzyme activation, and nutrient transport. It contributes to
disease resistance, water use efficiency, and enhances tolerance to stress
conditions.
Micronutrients
a) Iron (Fe): Iron is crucial for chlorophyll synthesis and plays a key role in
photosynthesis and energy production in plants. Iron deficiency can lead to
yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) and reduced crop productivity.
b) Zinc (Zn): Zinc is involved in various enzyme activities and plays a critical role
in plant hormone production, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism.
Zinc deficiency can lead to stunted growth, reduced yields, and impaired
nutrient uptake.
c) Manganese (Mn): Manganese is essential for photosynthesis, enzyme
activation, and nitrogen metabolism in plants. Manganese deficiency can lead
to yellowing between veins (interveinal chlorosis) and reduced crop yields.
d) Copper (Cu): Copper is involved in several metabolic processes, including
photosynthesis, respiration, and lignin synthesis. It contributes to plant
reproductive development, disease resistance, and enzyme activity. Copper
deficiency can result in wilting, leaf deformities, and reduced crop yields.
Similarly, fertile soil contains an optimal balance of essential nutrients necessary for
plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients.
Maintaining soil fertility is essential to support healthy crop development, high yields,
and nutrient-rich food production.
21Chapter 5: Objectives of Soil Health Program

assessment using farmer soil testing and laboratory analysis can help raise
awareness, build skills, and inspire students to become advocates for sustainable soil
management practices and guardians of our precious soil resources.
24Chapter 6: Soil Health Assessment Methods
Overview of Soil Health Card (SHC)
Government of India has started a scheme “National Mission for Sustainable
Agriculture” and Soil Health Management (SHM) is one of the most important
interventions under this scheme. SHM aims to promote crop specific sustainable soil
health management and judicious application of fertilizers.
Keeping this in view, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare introduced the Soil
Health Card (SHC) scheme on 19th February 2015 so as to provide a basis to address
nutritional deficiencies in fertilization practices. Under this scheme, 12 soil health
parameters are analysed and soil health card, a printed report are generated which
contains nutrient status of soil with respect to 12 nutrients as listed below:
A Soil Health Card provides the information for the nutrient status of soil, along with
recommendations on the dosage of nutrients to be utilized for improving its fertility and
health. SHC enables the farmers to apply recommended doses of nutrients based on
soil test values to realize improved and sustainable soil health and fertility, low costs
and higher profits.
25Sample of
Soil Health Card
SOPs for Soil Sampling & Processing of Sample for Testing
When to Sample?
Timing of sampling is important because soil properties vary depending on the time of
year and type of management practices used, such as tillage or nutrient application
just prior to testing. The best time of year to sample is when the climate is most stable
and there have been no recent disturbances, such as after harvesting or at the end of
the growing season.
Where to Sample?
1. For sampling of micronutrient analysis, always use auger made up of stainless
steel instead of rusted iron khurpi or spade.
2. Store soil samples in clean cloth or polythene bags.
3. Use glass or polythene jars for storage of soil samples for a longer duration.
4. Recently fertilized plots, bunds, channels, marshy tracts, area near trees, farm
ways, buildings, wells, compost piles or other non-representative locations must be
avoided during sampling.
26Basic soil sampling tools
Soil sampling tools are required to collect a uniform amount of soil at any given depth.
Various kinds of soil sampling tools are used/ recommended for the soil to be sampled
in different environments. Some of the basic soil sampling tools used are as shown
below -
Depth of soil sampling
S. No. Type of situation/ crop Depth of sampling
1. Cereals, vegetables, seasonal crops etc. 0-15 cm

Collection of soil samples
There are methods/ technique for collection of soil samples which vary according to
the purpose of sampling and a number of approaches may be employed. The two
techniques, i.e., Grid sampling & Zig-zag sampling are shown below –
27Grid sampling allows for a systematic, Zig-zag sampling provides the best
non-random, approach to soil sampling coverage of an area if care is taken with
which can be applied on a whole or for the sample collection. This is often the
sampling relatively smaller areas. It best strategy for collecting samples to

V-shaped soil sampling (15 cm soil sampling depth)
Procedure of V shaped method of soil
sampling:
1.Remove the surface litter, grass, debris, etc.,
from the sampling point
2.Drive the auger to a plough depth of 15 cm and
draw the soil sample
3.Collect at least 10 to 15 samples from each
sampling unit and place in a bucket or tray
4.If auger is not available, make a ‘V’ shaped cut
to a depth of 15 cm in the sampling spot using
spade
5. Remove thick slice of soil from top to bottom of
exposed face (2.5-3 cm) of the ‘V’ shaped cut and
place in a clean container.
Preparation of composite soil sample
1. Mix the collected soil samples thoroughly on a clean sheet.

29Processing of soil samples for analysis
• Drying- The soil samples are dried in shade.
• Grinding- The sample is grinded using mortar to prepare it for sieving.
• Sieving- Grinded soil sample is sieved through 2 mm stainless steel sieve and
for specific analyis like Organic Carbon use 0.2 – 0.5 mm sieve. Remove plant
residues, gravels, etc by retaining them on the sieve.

Do's and Don'ts for soil sampling, processing & testing in Indian conditions:
Do's:
1. Use a representative sampling method: Take multiple soil samples from
different locations within the field to account for soil variability. Use a zigzag or
W-pattern sampling approach to obtain a representative soil sample.
2. Sample at the right time: Soil sampling should ideally be done before the
planting season or during the fallow period.
3. Take samples at the appropriate depth: The depth of soil sampling depends on
the crop and its root zone. For most crops, a depth of 0-15 cm is suitable.
However, for deeper-rooted crops like sugarcane or tree plantations, sample
up to 30-60 cm depth or as recommended.
304. Use clean sampling tools: Ensure that sampling tools such as a soil probe,
auger, or shovel are clean and free from contaminants to prevent cross-
contamination.
5. Label samples properly: Clearly label each soil sample with unique identifiers,
including location, date, depth, and crop information. This helps in maintaining
proper records and ensures correct interpretation of test results.
6. Store and handle samples correctly: Store soil samples in clean, labelled
sample bags or containers to avoid mixing or contamination. Keep samples in
a cool, dry place until they are sent for testing.
Don'ts:
1. Don't sample from atypical areas: Avoid sampling from areas with known soil
variability, such as eroded spots, waterlogged areas, or areas near boundaries
where different management practices may have been followed.
2. Don't sample immediately after fertilizer application: Wait for a sufficient period
after fertilization to allow nutrients to mix uniformly in the soil. Sampling
immediately after fertilization may result in inaccurate nutrient readings.
3. Don't use non-representative sampling tools: Avoid using galvanized or rusty
tools. These can affect the accuracy of the test results.
4. Don't sample from surface residues: Do not collect samples from areas with
high surface residues. Remove surface residues from sample.
5. Don't rely solely on visual assessment: Visual soil assessments may provide
some indications of soil health, but they cannot accurately determine nutrient
deficiencies or imbalances. Soil testing is essential to obtain precise information
for making nutrient management decisions.
By adhering to these do's and don'ts, farmers, agronomists, and researchers can obtain
reliable soil test results.
31Soil Testing & Analysis
Soil testing is a set of various chemical processes that determine the amount of
available plant nutrients in the soil. It is important because it determines the exact
amount of available crop nutrients in the soil and provides a visible snapshot of soil
properties (chemical/ physical/ biological).
The results of soil testing will supply soil nutrients interpretation, which includes an
indication of whether that particular soil is low, medium or high/ deficient or sufficient
in that nutrient. Accordingly, fertilizer recommendations based on the analysis can be
made.
Digital Soil Testing Mini Lab/ PUSA STFR machine
PUSA STFR METER KIT (PUSA Soil Test and Fertiliser Recommendation Meter Kit)
is an advanced Soil Testing Kit authorised under the Government of India's Soil Health
Card mission. This Digital Soil Testing Mini Lab is a low cost, user friendly digital
embedded system instrument which can quantitatively estimate available nutrients in
soil.
It is a Soil Doctor that tests parameters of soil where the available nutrient in a soil is
extracted with an extractant and a colour is developed in the extract with another
reagent. The colour intensity which is proportional to the amount of nutrient extracted
is measured by this Soil Testing Meter. It recommends fertiliser dose from soil test
values of for over 100 crops, prints Soil Health Card through in-built thermal printer,
sends Soil Testing Report to mobile via Bluetooth and computer via USB.
32Significance of Digital Soil Testing Mini Lab/ PUSA SFTR machine
About 1244 soil testing laboratories (STLs) are available throughout the country, which
are not sufficient to cater the soil testing needs of the farming community. There was
long-felt need of a quantitative soil test kit to support the soil testing service. Digital
Soil Testing Mini Labs would increase farmers‟ access to soil testing, and thus help
them to achieve higher yields owing to soil test-based fertilizer application.
Using the Soil Testing kit (Do's and don'ts for soil testing using a soil testing
kit)
When conducting soil testing in a laboratory using a soil testing kit, it's important to
follow certain guidelines to ensure accurate and reliable results. Here are some do's
and don'ts for soil testing in a laboratory using a soil testing kit:
Do's:
1. Read and follow the instructions: Carefully read the instructions provided with the
soil testing kit and follow them step by step. Each kit may have specific guidelines for
sample preparation, reagent usage, and result interpretation.
2. Use clean equipment: Ensure that all equipment used for testing, including
containers, scoops, pipettes, and measuring devices, are clean and free from any
residues that could contaminate the samples.
3. Mix and homogenize the soil sample: Thoroughly mix the soil sample to ensure a
consistent representation of the field. Break up any clumps and remove stones or
debris that could interfere with the testing process.
4. Measure accurately: Follow the provided guidelines for accurately measuring the
soil and reagents. Use precise measuring devices, such as graduated cylinders or
syringes, to ensure correct volumes are added.
335. Perform controls and calibration: Many soil testing kits include control samples or
calibration standards. Use these samples to verify the accuracy of the kit and ensure
that the test results fall within the expected range.
Don'ts:
