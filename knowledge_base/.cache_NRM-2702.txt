xiiSoil and Nutrient Management
On-line soil fertility maps of different states and fertilizer
recommendation system for targeted yields of crops
Salient features
The soil fertility data on N, P and K index
values at district level for the states of Andhra
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, West
Bengal, Haryana, Odisha, Himachal Pradesh,
Karnataka, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Bihar have
been developed in MS-Access. From the
attribute database, the different thematic
layers have been reclassified to generate various
thematic maps on N, P and K index values
(IVs). The calculated soil-test values were
incorporated into the developed fertility maps to prescribe nutrients for targeted yields.
This application software was developed to recommend fertilizer doses for the targeted yield
at the district level. This system has the facility to input actual soil test values at the farmers’
fields to obtain optimum doses of fertilizers. The application is a user-friendly tool. It will
aid to the farmer in improving the efficiency (appropriate dose) of fertilizer use to achieve a
specific crop yield. The system is explained with the example of Tamil Nadu. The system
works as a ready reckonner to give prescription in the form of fertilizer available (eg. Urea,
SSP, MOP etc).
Performance results
This decision support system provides real use of fertility maps to the users. It can be
used up to field level, if the farmer has the knowledge of his field fertility status and the yield
target. It can be further narrowed down to block/village level depending on the availability
of information. The experiments conducted at different locations in the states suggest that a
considerable amount of fertilizer can be saved, if the fertilizers are prescribed using soil-test
values.
Cost of technology
Technology available in public domain (www.iiss.nic.in)
Impact and benefits
• Ensure site specific balanced fertilizers
• Facilitate distribution of fertilizer in the country
• Monitoring soil fertility status

Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource ManagementPUSA Soil-Test Fertilizer Recommendation (STFR) meter
Salient features
Pusa STFR Meter is a low cost, user friendly digital
embedded system instrument which is programmed
according to type of soil, type of crop and yield based on
ICAR research data base. The unique features of this
instrument are:
• It can quantitatively estimate as many as five important
soil parameters viz.,pH, Electrical conductivity, organic
carbon, phosphorus, potassium (sulphur, zinc and
boron in pipeline).
• It gives quantitative values, thus is more accurate than
other soil-test kits available in the market, which are
based on visual colour comparison.
• It is portable, and can be operated both by electricity and battery.
• It is user-friendly and easy to operate with minimum training.
• Unlike other soil test kits, it gives fertilizer recommendations for selected crops using the
in-built program.
Performance results
Tested and validated over one year with different soils with minimum 80 % accuracy.
Cost of technology
Maximum s30,000 with complete package of soil-testing.
Impact and benefits
In view of the ever-expanding multi-nutrient deficiencies in soils, site specific nutrient
management, which is considered as Fertilizer Best Management Practice, needs to be promoted
to improve soil health and crop productivity. Inadequate and unreliable soil-testing facilities,
poor awareness of farmers about balanced plant nutrition and lack of appropriate policy are
the major constraints in adoption of Fertilizer Best Management Practices. It is realized that
the soil-testing service has not made the desired impact and farmers have not yet been able to
adopt it in large numbers. On the other hand, on-station and on-farm experiments conducted
under diverse agro-ecologies across the country established the significance of soil-test based
balanced fertilizer use in improving crop yields and nutrient use efficiency. Compared with
farmers’ fertilizer practice, 20-25% yield gain could be easily obtained with the adoption of
soil-test based recommendations, although much greater advantages are also reported
depending on soil conditions and crops/cropping systems. The Pusa STFR Meter would
increase farmers’ access to soil testing, and thus help them to achieve higher yields owing to
soil test based fertilizer application.

Natural Resource Management: Technologies Ready for CommercializationIron (Fe) enrichment in rice, maize and pulses
Salient features
• About 15% Indian soils are deficient in Fe and it is
the most common nutritional disorder in human
beings affecting at least half of the India’s population.
• The fertilization strategies physiological
interventions have been developed to enrich the
grains with Fe.
• In rice and maize, two sprays of ferrous sulphate @
0.5% solution at the time of pre- and post-anthesis are
sufficient along with basal application of ferrous sulphate
@ 50 kg ha-1 at planting. In Fe rich soils, only two
foliar sprays are enough to enrich the grains with Fe.
• In pulse crops (chick pea and pigeon pea), 25%
defoliation or nipping at bud before flowering along
with one spray either at flowering or pod formation
stage has proved to be effective in enhancing grain
Fe concentration.
Performance results
• One foliar spray along with 25% defoliation is best strategy for enhancing Fe content in
chick pea (17-25%) while nipping is the best strategy to enhance Fe content in pigeon pea
grain (24-32.8%).
• Fe concentration in grains of rice and maize can be increased by 9-23% with the application
of ferrous sulphate @ 50 kg ha-1 along with two foliar sprays at pre- and post- anthesis.
Cost of technology
• Cost of Fe enrichment varies with crop, the soil types, amount of fertilizer used and method of
fertilizer application.
• Manual nipping and defoliation enhances the cost but new machinery may be useful in
minimizing labour cost on such intervention. On an average, cost of Fe enrichment varies
between 21,500 and 3,500/ha.
• Output also varies with crop response to fertilization. On average, output range between
27,000 and 20,000/ha.
Impact and benefits
This strategy is considered as a relatively low cost, highly efficient and safer than diet
supplementation approaches in prevention of nutritional deficiencies to combat dietary mineral
inadequacies in rural areas. Fe bio-fortified products appear to be better sources of potentially
bioavailable Fe in comparison with the non-fortified analogues.

Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource ManagementTechniques for correcting zinc (Zn) deficiency
Salient features
• Wide spread Zn deficiency in soils of India (45%) not only
causes loss in crops yield but also overlaps with malnutrition
in animal and human. It is further hampered by low use
efficiency of Zn carriers/ fertilizers (seldom exceeds 5%).
• Zinc, which is associated with many metallo-enzymes in plant
can be supplemented in crops through different sources viz.
zinc sulphate hepta hydrate (ZnSO .7H O), Zn chelates,
4 2
Zincated urea/ super phosphate, Zinc oxide, Zinc phosphate
and Zn enriched organic manures. Among these sources,
ZnSO is cheapest, easily available and most effective source
4
of Zn in crops.
• Zinc can be supplemented to different crops at different time
through any of the following methods (as suitable to the crop).
Seed Coating: zinc oxide/ Teprosyn-Zn/ zinc phosphate slurry
Root dipping: zinc oxide/ zinc phosphate
Basal application : zinc sulphate @ 5.0 kg Zn ha-1
sufficient for 2-3 crop cycles (rate varied with crops and soils)
or 4-5t FYM+2.5 kg Zn ha-1
or Top dressing : zinc sulphate (if not applied as basal)
Foliar application : 0.5 to 2.0% zinc sulphate (supplement to basal application)
Performance results
• Use of Zn in balanced fertilization improved yield of different crops to a tune of 10-35%
depending upon soil types, severity of deficiency, crops etc.
• Application of Zn alone contributes about 25 million tonne of total food grain production.
It sustained the productivity over the years.
• The National Food Security Mission has adopted the Zn in fertilization package and provides
a subsidy of R500 ha-1 for Zn fertilizer to each crop.
Cost of technology
Cost of Zn application varies with amount of Zn fertilizer used and labour required. On an
average, cost of Zn fertilizer use varies between R500 and 2,000 ha-1. Output also varied with crop
response to fertilization. On average, output range between .1,000 and 20,000ha-1.
Impact and benefits
Application of zinc enchances crop yield and profit by 10-35% and can has the potential to
contribute 25 million tonnes of food grain production. Besides, the package has become a part of
National Food Security Mission (NFSM).

Natural Resource Management: Technologies Ready for CommercializationBalanced fertilization through sulphur application
Salient features
• About 40% of Indian soils are
deficient in S which causes great
economic loss in several crops
especially, oilseeds and pulses.
• Inclusion of sulphur in balanced
NPK fertilization schedule in S
deficient soil is based on large
number of experiments conducted
at farmers’ fields at varying S
status with different sources, rates
and methods of application.
• Sulphur uptake by crops ranged
from 5 kg to more than 50 kg S
ha-1 year-1 depending on type of
crop, available S at the crops’ disposal, availability of other nutrients, growth
conditions and cropping intensity.
• Among different sources, single super phosphate, gypsum, phospho-gypsum,
ammonium sulphate, bentonite S pastilles were better for rectification of S
deficiency. Pyrite, a good source of S should be applied in moist soil through
surface broadcast before one month of planting to meet S requirement of the
crops.
• Basal application of S sources is beneficial, however, it can be used at 25-30
days crop growth stages in case of oilseeds.
• The recommendations/technology options developed for correction of
S deficiency for different crops/ cropping systems are:
• Rice-wheat cropping system : 30 kg S ha-1 in each crop
45 kg S ha-1 to rice
• Other cereal based cropping system(s) : 30- 45 kg S ha-1
• Pulse-based cropping system(s) : 35-45 kg S ha-1
• Oilseeds-based cropping system(s) : 45-60 kg S ha-1
• Sugarcane : 80 kg ha-1
• Green gram/Black gram/Lentil : 30 kg S ha-1
5
Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource ManagementPerformance results
• More than 40 crops responded to S application in S deficient soils in more than
140 districts of the country.
• The yield advantage due to S application over NPK recorded from 10 to 30%
in cereals, 15-40% in pulses and 15-45% in oilseeds. The additional net profit
obtained with S application varied from R5,000 to R39,000 per hectare.
• Long-term experiments showed sustainable yield trend with NPKS fertilization
schedule and utilization efficiency of NPK increased with inclusion of S in
fertilization schedule.
Cost of technology
Cost of S fertilization varies from R700 to 1,500 ha-1.
Impact and benefits
The technology has the scope of improving yield (10-40%) of various crops
and enhancing oil content in oil seed crops. It has vast scope of application in more
than 140 districts of the country.

Natural Resource Management: Technologies Ready for CommercializationAmeliorating deficiency of Manganese (Mn) in field crops
Salient features
• Manganese deficiency is increasing in rice-
wheat systems grown in Indo-gangetic plains
having highly permeable coarse textured
alkaline soils with low organic matter.
• The principle of any micronutrient
including Mn recommendations for
different crops and cropping systems is
based on its available status in soil, requirements to meet the crops/cropping
system and fixation in soil complex and other losses.
• Durum wheat genotypes are more susceptible to Mn deficiency than aestivum wheat.
• Manganese (Mn) can be supplied through the sulphate salt of Mn i.e. MnSO
4
either through soil or foliar.
• Three to four foliar spray of 0.5-1.0% MnSO solution is more efficient and
4
economical for enhancing wheat yield in sandy soils.
• Foliar spray of MnSO solution one before and two after first irrigation is
4
effective in mitigating Mn deficiency in crops in Mn-deficient soils.
Performance results
• Different crops and cropping systems, especially wheat performed tremendously
with application of Mn in deficient soils.
• Application of Mn enhances the farmers profit by 10-35% depending upon
crop type and crop response to Mn fertilization.
• Replenishment of Mn improves the fertility and soil health, and also increases
the utilization of other macronutrients, reducing leaching losses and thus helpful
in saving environment.
Cost of technology
Cost of Mn application varies with amount of fertilizer used and labour required.
Foliar spray enhances labour cost. On average, cost of micronutrient fertilizer use
varied between R700 and 2,000 ha-1. Output also varies with crop response to
fertilization. On average, output ranges between R2,500 and 15,000 ha-1.
Impact and benefits
Application of Mn enhances the farmer profit and improve the soil health.

Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource ManagementBio-enriched compost
Salient features
Bi-enriched Compost
Normal farm compost could be converted into
a superior bio-enriched compost by amending with
1% P as rock phosphate along with inoculating
Azospirillum/Azotobacter and Phosphate
Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) (108-109 cfu/g) each
and subsequently curing for about 20 to 25 days
in shade at 25% moisture level. To maintain the
moisture, curing materials should be covered
with a polythene sheet/gunny bags. Quality
improvement of the final product results because
of the change of following characteristics over normal farm compost:-
• Stabilization of C:N ratio around 10.0 to12:1
• pH stabilizes around neutral (7 to 7.5)
• CEC of final product increases above 25%
• Microbial carbon increases more than 100 times.
• Viable population of Azospirillum/ Azotobacter and PSB increases 300-400 times and
six times, respectively.
Performance results
• Use of bio-enriched compost @ 1 tonne/ha could minimize the recommended
nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizer to 50% without any yield loss of crops grown in
rice- toria and rice- wheat sequence.
• Biofertilizers with increased dose of compost @ 2 tonne/ha, more specifically enriched
compost could reduce recommended N, P fertilizer up to 75% in subsequent year due
to cumulative effects of INM package.
Cost of technology
Preparation of Bio-enriched compost involves modest additional cost of the price of
low grade Rock Phosphate and biofertilizer over that of normal compost. Every tonne of
Bio-enriched compost requires around 170 kg rock phosphate and 10 kg of Azospirillum/
Azotobacter and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) biofertilizer. Considering the cost
of Rock Phosphate R3/ kg and biofertilizer R75/ kg, additional cost for each tonne of
Bio-enriched compost preparation is about R2,000/ only.
Impact and benefits
Incorporation of enriched compost with subsequent reduction of fertilizers (N, P)
showed improved soil health. Huge amount of foreign exchange can be saved for importing
chemical fertilzers.

Natural Resource Management: Technologies Ready for CommercializationTechnology for preparation of enriched compost
Salient features
• A new technology has been developed to
prepare enriched compost using low-grade rock
phosphate, waste mica and crop residues.
• For this purpose, a trench or pit is filled layer-
wise (5-6 layers).
• Biodegradable organic materials like crop
residues, farm wastes, animal feed wastes and
tree leaves are spread on the floor of the trench
(about 20-cm thick layer).
• A layer of rock phosphate (RP), followed by waste mica is then spread over biodegradable
organic material.
• Cattle-dung is made into slurry by adding water, and this is sprinkled over RP and waste-
mica layer.
• Layering is repeated till whole compostable materials are added.
• Moisture content is maintained throughout the composting period at 60% of water-
holding capacity.
• Periodic turning (monthly interval) is done to provide aeration.
• Composting is continued for 4 months.
• For the preparation of 1 t enriched compost, 1 t biomass (crop residues/ biodegradable
wastes, 200 kg low-grade rock phosphate (18-20% P O), 200 kg waste mica (9-10%
2 5
KO), and 100 kg fresh cattle dung are required.
2
Performance results
• The enriched compost contains 1.4-1.5% total N, 5.0–6.0% total P O and 2.5-3.0%
2 5
KO, respectively. Therefore, addition of one tonne (1,000 kg) of enriched compost
2
will substitute about 14-15 kg of N, 50-60 kg of P O and 25-30 kg of KO, respectively.
2 5 2
Cost of technology
]2,00,000
Impact and benefits
Enriched compost would reduce dependence on costly phosphorus and potassium
fertilizers. Hence, it will reduce cost of cultivation in one hand and increase income of the
farmers on the other. Large quantities of crop residues may be recycled back to the field after
converting them into quality manure. Substantial amounts of rock phosphate and waste
mica may be recycled in agriculture as a source of phosphorus and potassium and thus lead
to the utilization of indigenous mineral resources. Huge amount of foreign exchange can be
saved partly or wholly on import of costly P and K fertilizers.

Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource ManagementPhosphate solubilizers
(Trichoderma sp. and Penicillium sp.)
Salient features
• Phosphorus is considered to be one of the major
nutrient elements limiting agricultural production in
acidic soils. Phosphate solubilizing fungi (PSF) play
an important role in supplementing phosphorus from
insoluble phosphate source to the plants.
• Easy multiplication of PSF for application in phosphate
deficient soils. It also increases plant growth, induces
resistance and control soil borne phytopathogens like
Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Sclerotium and Sclerotinia.
• The Trichoderma and Penicillium based formulations,
respectively, have 50-67 and 40-45% phosphate
solubilising potential on inorganic insoluble source of
phosphate like ferric phosphate and tricalcium
phosphate.
Performance results
The technology is cost effective and easy to apply in the acidic soils.
Cost of technology
R400.0 per ha (or) R100 per kg.
Impact and benefits
Adoption of technology leads to enhanced (i) phosphorus availability, (ii) growth
promotion and (iii) biological disease management in acidic soils.

Natural Resource Management: Technologies Ready for CommercializationVermicomposting technology for recycling of organic wastes
Salient features
Vermicomposting is a very effective method of converting wastes into useful manure
with the help of earthworms. For vermicomposting, open permanent pits of 102 ft × 32 ft × 22 ft
dimensions are made under the shade of a tree at an elevated place, about 2 feet above the
ground to avoid entry of rainwater into the pits. Brick walls are constructed above the floor
of the pits leaving 5-6 gaps in the pit wall of 10 cm dia to facilitate aeration. These holes are
blocked with nylon screen (100 mesh) to prevent escape of earthworms from the pits. 3-4
cm thick layer of partially decomposed dung (about 2-month-old) is spread on the bottom
of the pits. A layer of litter/residue and dung in the ratio of 1:1 (w/w) is then added. A
second layer of dung is then applied followed by another layer of litter/crop residue in the
same ratio up to a height of 2 feet. Two species of epigeic earthworms viz., Eisenia foetida and
Perionyx excavatus are inoculated in the pits or heaps. Watering by sprinkler is done intermittently.
Moisture content is maintained at 60-70% throughout the composting period. Jute bags
(gunny bags) are spread uniformly on the surface to facilitate maintenance of suitable moisture
regime and temperature. The material is allowed to decompose for 15-20 days to stabilize the
temperature after the initial thermophilic stage. Earthworms were then inoculated in the pit
@ 10 adult earthworms per kg of waste material and a total of 5,000 worms were added to
each pit or heap. The materials were allowed to decompose for 110 days. The forest litter
decomposes faster (75 to 85 days) than farm residues (110-115 days). In the heap method
the waste materials and partially decomposed dung (1:1 w/w) are made out into heaps of 10
feet length × 3 feet width × 2 feet high and during inoculation, channels are made by hand
and earthworm @ 1 kg per quintal of waste are inoculated and then watering is done by
sprinkling. Pieces of jute cloth are used as covering material.
Performance results
Under organic farming systems, combined application of cattle dung manure (2 t/ha) +
Vermicompost (1.5 tonne/ha) and poultry manure (1.5 tonne/ha) + biofertilizer @5kg/ha
sustained the productivity of soybean, chick pea and mustard and isabgol crops as well as
biological health of soil.
Cost of technology
About 3 tonnes of vermicompost can be produced from 10 beds of 10 ft × 3 ft × 2 ft
each. The cost of earthworms is .400-500 per kg. A 50-kg bag of vermicompost can be sold
for .150 (.3,000/tonne). Basically, vermicompost is used like any other manure: .5,000
kg/ha in cropping and 1-10 kg/ tree in plantations, depending on the size of tree.
Impact and benefits
This technology is better in terms of faster decomposition of the waste over conventional
method. Secondly the nutrient composition of the vermicompost is superior over
conventional compost.

Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource ManagementCrop Management/Farming System
Integration of reduced tillage and BBF land configuration for
better productivity of rainfed cotton
Salient features
The technology is the package of the reduced
tillage (one harrowing and intercultural operation with
pre-emergence herbicide), followed by Broad Bed and
Furrow (BBF) planting of rainfed cotton. The BBF
are formed by BBF maker that makes one meter wide
bed followed by 50 cm wide furrow of about 15 cm
depth. The cotton crop is supplied with recommended
dose of fertilizers along with location specific deficient
micronutrients.
Performance results
The reduced tillage (one harrowing and
intercultural operation with pre-emergence herbicide)
followed by Broad Bed and Furrow planting of rainfed cotton applied with recommended dose of
fertilizers, provided the rainfed cotton farmers with 32.6 % higher yields of seed cotton when
compared to farmers’ practice (rainfed cotton cultivation on flat beds with conventional tillage
involving one summer ploughing followed by 2-3 harrowing with intercultural operations and
application of about 70 % of recommended fertilizer dose).
Cost of technology
The cost of technology is ]10,933/ha (Kovilpatti, Tamil Nadu) to 111,933/ha (Khargone,
Madhya Pradesh). The net returns/ benefits to the farmers from the adoption of the technological
package were in the range of .4,955/ha (Kovilpatti, Tamil Nadu) to .18,936/ha (Khargone,
Madhya Pradesh) per hectare.
Impact and benefits
The new technology will add to the income of the farmers. The net returns from the package
varied from around .5,000 (Kovilpatti, Tamil Nadu) to 19,000 per hectare (Khargone, Madhya
Pradesh). In addition to it, the technology provided the intangible benefits of improvement in soil
health, reduction in the runoff and soil losses, better drainage of excess runoff water from the fields.
The reduced tillage in combination with residue incorporation and proper nutrition has yielded
equal or higher than intensive tillage, which has reduced the energy requirements on one hand and
good economic returns to the farmers on the other.

Natural Resource Management: Technologies Ready for CommercializationIncome maximization through participatory
INM for soybean-wheat system
Salient features
Nutrient management is a crucial issue
with resource poor small farmers. More often
there exists a mismatch between the farmers’
resources and farmers’ practices. Therefore a
need was felt for participatory nutrient
management at farmers’ fields. Seven
Integrated nutrient management modules were
tested for two years at the institute for their effectiveness vis a vis farmers resources.
Two best modules are very suitable for upscaling. These are: i) Balanced Fertilization
(BF) i.e. 100% Recommended rate of N, P, K, S, Zn to soybean and 100%
recommended rate of NPKS to wheat; ii) Integrated Nutrient Management (INM)
ie. 50% Recommended rate of NPKS + 5 t FYM/ha +Rhizobium to soybean and
75% of Recommended rate of NPKS + PSB to wheat.
Performance results
The INM technology i.e. 50% NPKS+5t FYM+ Rhizobium to soybean and
75%NPKS+PSB to wheat produced 24-60% higher soybean – wheat productivity.
Similarly balanced fertilization also improved the soybean and wheat yield by 23-
30 per cent. The choice between the two technologies depended upon the availability
of FYM with the farmers.
Cost of technology
Total cost of INM and balanced fertilizer application was R21,621 and
R 22,668/ha. However, the net returns were R61,240 and R60,342/ha respectively.
The BC ratio was the highest (2.83) with INM intervention.
Impact and benefits
The technology ensure maximum income to the farmers along with favourable
improvements in soil properties.

Salient features
To maximize grain yield and water saving
in rice cultivation, SRI method was modified
to make it suitable for eastern India. Optimum
spacing, water management practice and
N-requirements for SRI method were
standardized.
Performance results
The System of Rice Intensification (SRI)
with 20 cm x 20 cm saved about 22-35% of
water, 14% labour inputs and gave 36-49%
higher yield (about 6 t/ha) than conventional
transplanted crop.
Cost of the technology
.25,000 /ha
Impact and benefits
It has potential to enhance rice yield upto 49% with less water than conventional
transplanting method. In SRI, only 1,571 litres water was required to produce
1 kg seed, but with conventional method 2,801 litres water was needed for 1 kg
seed production. The SRI method also showed reduction in labour inputs by 14%
than the conventional transplanting method for various cultural practices.

Natural Resource Management: Technologies Ready for CommercializationIntegrated System of Rice Intensification (SRI)
Salient features
To maximize land and water productivity of
rainfed paddy land, 10% of the total rice field was
converted into small dugout ponds (refuge) at
downstream to harvest rainwater from the field.
The stored water in the pond is used for short-
duration aquaculture during monsoon and its
embankment is used for growing horticultural
crops. The conserved rainwater in the pond is used
for giving supplemental irrigations to kharif paddy
and irrigating horticultural crops. To enhance rice
productivity, rice was grown by SRI method and Layout design of integrated system of rice
intensification
rice field was kept without any stagnant water
during vegetative stage of crop growth. This
technology referred to here as Integrated SRI
(ISRI) includes combining SRI methods of rice
cultivation and pond/refuge to conserve rainwater
for multiple use.
Performance results
The kharif paddy yield increased from 2.89
tonne/ha to 6.16 t/ha with fish yield of 2.6 tonne/
ha. The Integrated SRI system has potential to
generate net profit of R268,600 ha-1 in the two years. The net water productivity (NWP) in
the Integrated SRI system was enhanced from . 0.31/ m3 (Conventional rainfed rice) to
.18.91/ m3 in economic gain per volume of water.
Cost of the technology
.136,000/ha
Impact and benefits
This technology has potential to enhance both land and water productivity in rainfed
medium lands. The Output Value: Cost of Cultivation ratio indicates that in the Integrated
SRI system for an investment of .1, one can get a return of .2.97, almost three times back,
however, in conventional rice system this ratio is 1:1.13.

Agricultural Technologies: Natural Resource ManagementTechnology of Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)
Salient features
Sowing of rice seeds done directly into field
though multi-crop planters or zero till seed –cum-
fertilizer drill in dry or optimum moisture
conditions. If sown dry, it has to be followed by
irrigation.
Seed rate: 20-25 kg per ha
Nutrient management: Basal @200 kg NPK
(12:32:16) should be drilled at sowing + 50 kg
MOP ha-1. 25 kg zinc sulphate ha-1 to be applied at
7–10 days after sowing (DAS). Urea topdressing:
300 kg urea ha-1 to be applied in three splits at
50 kg ha-1 at early establishment (15-20 DAS) and
at 125 kg ha-1 each at active tillering (25-30 DAS)
and panicle initiation (45-55 DAS).
Water management: Soil moisture should be kept
approximately at field capacity for first 20 days
followed by irrigation at 7-10 days interval
depending upon rainfall, upto around 80-85 days growth. Later on, again the soil moisture
should be kept at field capacity up to maturity. Irrigation should be stopped 7-10 days prior
to harvest.
Weed management: Pre-emergence application of weedicide viz. Oxadirgyl 90 g ai ha-1 or
Stomp/ pendimethalin at 1000 g ai ha-1 at 2–3 DAS followed by azimsulfuron at 35 g ai ha-1 or
fenoxaprop with safener + ethoxysulfuron 90 + 18 g ai ha-1 as POST at 20–25 DAS. One
hand weeding should be done to avoid weed competition.
Performance results
Almost comparable yield can be achieved with puddled transplanted rice particularly in
Basmati type fine grain varieties. In case of coarse grain high yielding varieties also, comparable
yields can be achieved with proper agronomic management.
