INFRASTRUCTURE:
STRENGTHENING CONNECTIVITY,
CAPACITY AND COMPETITIVENESS
Infrastructure continues to be central to India’s growth strategy, with public
capital expenditure following a sustained upward trajectory since FY15 and
gaining further momentum in recent years. Large-scale investments across
roads, railways, ports, power, aviation and digital infrastructure have
strengthened connectivity, expanded capacity and improved logistics efficiency,
generating strong multiplier effects for growth and productivity. This phase has
been characterised not only by rapid asset creation but also by a shift towards
integrated, system-level development.
A defining feature of this transition has been the institutionalisation of
multimodal planning through PM GatiShakti, complemented by the National
Logistics Policy and digital platforms that are reducing transaction costs and
execution risks. Reforms in infrastructure financing—spanning project finance
regulation, Public-Private Partnership (PPP) frameworks, asset monetisation
and capital market instruments—are crowding-in private investment. At the
same time, India’s infrastructure base is broadening to include digital public
infrastructure (DPI), clean energy, resilient water systems and emerging
sectors. Sustaining investment momentum while aligning infrastructure with
efficiency, sustainability and competitiveness will continue to remain key
towards supporting India’s medium-term growth and its long-term vision of
Viksit Bharat @2047.
INTRODUCTION: INFRASTRUCTURE AS THE ENGINE OF
GROWTH
9.1 The decisive role of infrastructure investment in India’s growth strategy has been a
defining feature in recent years. Union Budget priorities since FY20 reflect a sustained
shift toward large-scale public capital expenditure, supported by integrated planning,
and the systemic modernisation of logistics and connectivity networks.
9.2 This period has been marked not just by the accelerated expansion of traditional
infrastructure, such as highways, railways, ports, and energy systems, but also by the
expansion of digital public infrastructure (DPI), data systems, and assets aligned with
renewable energy. Together, these developments signal a shift in how India plans and
finances infrastructure projects, moving beyond mere capacity addition to focusing on
enhancing efficiency, competitiveness and network integration.

9.3 A major element of this shift has been the substantial increase in public capital
expenditure. Between FY19 and FY22, the Government of India’s capital expenditure
increased by 92 per cent, from ₹3.07 lakh crore to ₹5.92 lakh crore. This momentum has
been sustained over the subsequent fiscal years, reinforcing the objective of expanding
access to quality infrastructure across the country.
9.4 The Government of India’s capital outlay has increased by nearly 89 per cent,
from ₹5.92 lakh crore in FY22 to a budgeted allocation of ₹11.21 lakh crore for FY26,
recognising the strong multiplier effects that infrastructure generates on the economy.
Public expenditure on infrastructure has a high multiplier effect, estimated by studies
to be around 2.5 to 3.5 times the GDP over the medium term.1 This means, for every
rupee spent by the government in creating infrastructure, GDP gains worth ₹2.5-₹3.5
accrue.2 The scale and consistency of this investment momentum have positioned
infrastructure as a cornerstone of India’s growth engine.

9.5 This investment push has been paired with major institutional and technological
reforms designed to enhance planning quality and reduce execution risks also through
private participation. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, launched in 2021, has
successfully institutionalised multimodal, GIS-enabled planning. The recent launch
of PM GatiShakti Public has further democratised the platform, providing regulated

access to geospatial data for private developers and researchers to leverage advanced
analytics for infrastructure planning and investment decisions.3
9.6 Complementary initiatives under the National Logistics Policy (NLP) have
supported the emergence of a more predictable and digitised logistics environment.
The use of the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and the insights drawn from
the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) framework are actively improving
logistics efficiency, which directly affects the competitiveness of India's manufacturing
sector. A detailed analysis of the impact of the PM GatiShakti framework, the National
Logistics Policy, and other initiatives aimed at reducing logistics costs and improving
competitiveness is presented in the Infrastructure and Logistics section in Chapter 8
on Industry.
9.7 Beyond physical assets, DPI acts as an essential force multiplier across the economy.
The expansion of BharatNet, the deployment of 5G networks, and the continued growth
of platforms like Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Aadhaar, ULIP, DigiYatra,
FASTag, form the essential digital backbone upon which smart, efficient, and inclusive
infrastructure services are delivered at scale.
9.8 Overall, infrastructure remains a key lever for sustaining medium-term growth
through (i) continued public capex and improved project planning and execution, (ii)
crowding-in of private investment through a stronger Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
pipeline, (iii) deeper and more resilient long-term financing via capital markets and
prudentially sound bank/NBFC credit.
9.9 While public capital expenditure on infrastructure has expanded significantly in
recent years, its effectiveness increasingly depends on the quality of project planning,
prioritisation and execution. Evidence from various studies suggests that time and
cost overruns in large infrastructure projects are often linked to gaps in upstream
project preparation, including weak feasibility assessments, incomplete Detailed
Project Reports (DPRs), rigid procurement practices, and delays in dispute resolution.
Strengthening institutional capacity across the project lifecycle, including improved
project preparation, lifecycle-based costing, standardised contracts, faster dispute
resolution, wider adoption of technology, and skill development are critical to delivering
infrastructure faster, at scale, and within budget.
9.10 The subsequent sections of this chapter discuss measures to enhance
infrastructure financing and provide a detailed review of progress, outlook,
and challenges across key infrastructure sub-sectors, including core physical
infrastructure, energy sector, digital infrastructure, rural infrastructure and emerging

sectors infrastructure. Discussions pertaining to urban infrastructure and social
infrastructures, such as health and education, are covered separately in Chapters 15
and 11, respectively.
ENHANCING INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING AND PRIVATE
PARTICIPATION
9.11 India’s infrastructure financing landscape is undergoing a change and shifting
from a historical dependence on bank credit toward a diversified ecosystem of
alternative financing vehicles and capital market instruments. While bank credit to the
infrastructure sector recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 4.6 per cent in October
2025, recovering from 2.3 per cent YoY growth in October 2024, the incremental
expansion of financing is increasingly being driven by non-bank channels.
9.12 Credit flows from non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) (net of bank
borrowings), to the commercial sector grew at a robust compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 43.3 per cent during FY20 to FY25, significantly outpacing the 25 per cent
CAGR recorded for non-food bank credit over the same period.4 This evolving landscape
has been further strengthened by the growing role of Infrastructure Investment Trusts
(InvITs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which are enabling long-term
institutional capital to participate in infrastructure assets (Chart IX.3). Together,
these developments are helping to mitigate systemic risks by reducing asset–liability
mismatches on bank balance sheets, while enhancing the sustainability of financing for
long-gestation infrastructure projects.

9.13 A major regulatory milestone in infrastructure credit is the RBI (Project Finance)
Directions 2025, effective from 01 October 2025. These guidelines introduce a unified
framework for project lending across all financial institutions, ensuring a consistent
approach to large-scale financing. A key feature of these directions is the revised
treatment of the Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations (DCCO). This
provides a more realistic way to handle project delays, which helps in better identifying
actual stress and preventing the artificial ‘evergreening’ of loans. Furthermore, by
aligning the definition of the ‘Infrastructure Sector’ with the government’s Harmonised
Master List (HML) of infrastructure sub-sectors, the RBI has ensured regulatory clarity
and policy synchronisation across the entire financial ecosystem.
9.14 Capital-market channels for long-term funding and asset recycling have also
been strengthened through incremental reforms. SEBI’s Small and Medium Real
Estate Investment Trusts (SM REIT) framework reduced the minimum asset size
relative to existing REITs, from ₹500 crore to ₹50 crore. It also introduced a scheme-
based structure, allowing multiple schemes to be managed under one SM REIT. Each
scheme’s proposed assets are generally required to be at least ₹50 crore and less than
₹500 crore. This broadens the universe of monetizable real estate assets and can
support urban regeneration/commercial infrastructure by bringing smaller, stabilised
assets into a regulated pooled vehicle.
9.15 Additionally, SEBI has decided that from 01 January 2026, investments by
Mutual Funds and Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) in REITs will be treated as
equity-related instruments, which is expected to ease participation constraints and
potentially improve secondary market liquidity. From April to November 2025, ₹13,893
crore was raised by listed Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure
Investment Trusts (InvITs).5
Public-Private Partnerships
9.16 PPPs are vital mechanisms through which governments can leverage private
sector expertise and resources to address critical infrastructure needs. They play a
significant role in bridging infrastructure gaps and enhancing the efficiency of service
delivery. The success of PPPs is largely dependent on the robustness of institutional
frameworks, financial support, and the adoption of standardised documents, such as
the Model Request for Qualification (RfQ), Model Request for Proposal (RfP), and
Model Concession Agreements (MCAs).
9.17 India’s infrastructure programs support a variety of PPP models, including

management contracts like Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Design-Build-Finance-
Operate-Transfer (DBFOT), Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM), and Toll-Operate-Transfer
(TOT). Within the BOT framework, two variants exist—BOT (Toll) and BOT (Annuity)—
distinguished by the allocation of traffic risk.
9.18 According to the World Bank’s Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Report
2024,6 India has consistently ranked among the top five countries globally in terms of
private investment in infrastructure among low- and middle-income economies. India
also emerged as the largest recipient of PPI investment in South Asia, accounting for
over 90 per cent of the region’s total private infrastructure investment. This strong
global standing is reflected domestically in the marked increase in project approvals by
the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC), as illustrated in Chart
IX.4. The key institutional and policy mechanisms underpinning India’s PPP framework
are discussed in Box IX.1, while the priorities shaping its next phase are outlined in

Box IX.2: Public–Private Partnerships (PPP)- Strengthening
the Partnership Paradigm
India’s PPP programme has traversed a full learning curve since the first wave of projects
in the early 2000s. In the initial phase, multiple PPP models were tested across sectors,
with some projects encountering stress or failure. These experiences informed successive
improvements in model concession agreements, policy guidelines, and institutional practices
by addressing contractual weaknesses, risk-allocation errors, and regulatory gaps. Over
time, this iterative process has converted early experimentation into codified frameworks
and institutional memory.
As a result, the environment for private participation in infrastructure is materially stronger
in select core sectors. Roads, ports, power, and renewable energy now attract sustained
private capital, supported by more stable policy regimes, standardised contracts, and
clearer regulatory architectures. These sectors have transitioned from infancy to relative
maturity through deliberate sequencing of reforms. For instance, tariff regulation in ports
was initially institutionalised through the Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP) and
subsequently withdrawn as market depth and competition improved, underscoring the
need for regulation to evolve with sector maturity.
The next challenge is to extend this maturity to a new generation of PPPs in emerging
and socially critical sectors such as health, education, warehousing, sanitation, urban
infrastructure, green hydrogen, and the broader energy transition. In these areas,
conventional concession-style risk transfer is often insufficient. PPPs must increasingly
reflect the third “P” — Partnership — where public and private actors co-design projects,
share early-stage risks, and align incentives around long-term service outcomes rather than
narrow financial closure.
Accordingly, India’s PPP framework needs to move from transaction-centric execution
toward system-level market building, with a sharper focus on reducing structural uncertainty.
This requires clearer sectoral pipelines with multi-year visibility, a tighter linkage between
national programmes (PM GatiShakti, National Infrastructure Pipeline, sector missions),
and bankable project preparation, as well as disciplined pre-construction risk closure by
the public authority. PPP outcomes have been weakest where land acquisition, statutory
clearances, demand assessment, or utility shifting have remained unresolved. In the coming
decade, a credible PPP regime will be defined less by risk transfer on paper and more by the
State’s capacity to absorb early-stage risks that private capital cannot efficiently price.
While PPP frameworks have matured at the central level and in select sectors, challenges
persist at the sub-national level. The distinction between PPPs and Engineering Procurement
and Construction (EPC) contracts—namely that PPPs are partnerships rather than vendor
arrangements—is not always fully understood. Trust deficits and a limited understanding
of risk–reward principles continue to constrain the uptake of PPPs in several states and
urban local bodies. These challenges are compounded by uneven institutional capacity, even
as states and cities account for a rising share of infrastructure demand. The next reform
frontier lies in professionalising PPP cells, adopting programmatic approaches instead of
project-by-project experimentation, and leveraging data platforms to track performance,
renegotiation, and lifecycle outcomes. In this context, the Department of Economic Affairs’
346
346Investment and Infrastructure: Strengthening Connectivity, Capacity and Competitiveness
schemes such as the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) and Viability
Gap Funding (VGF) are important.
An often-overlooked aspect relates to public perception. PPPs are sometimes perceived as
‘selling of assets’ rather than long-term service partnerships, particularly at the state level.
Improving communication and transparency is therefore important for sustaining public
acceptance and investor confidence, especially for projects with long concession periods.
The perception principle has improved by a long margin among central projects as compared
with States. The lesson is often lost that wrong signalling in this regard creates two problems
– adversely affecting the public mood and driving away investors willing to stomach the
entirety of risks across a long concession period (30-60 years).
India has also consciously deepened the financial architecture supporting PPPs since
2014. Long-term domestic capital, including pension funds, insurance funds, InvITs and
Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), has increasingly participated in brownfield assets.
However, greenfield PPPs continue to rely heavily on bank balance sheets. Expanding
construction-period risk mitigation tools, partial credit guarantees in social sectors, take-
out financing, and standardised refinancing frameworks can materially lower the cost of
capital. Equally important is creating predictable exit and restructuring pathways for
stressed but viable projects, so that failure does not permanently impair investor confidence.
A renegotiation framework for complex cases to prevent project termination is worth
exploring. PPPs should be treated as evolving financial assets rather than one-time contracts
frozen at financial close.
Finally, private sector participants that have benefitted from de-risked brownfield assets
should be encouraged to increase their risk appetite for greenfield projects, particularly
through pure-play PPP models such as BOT, especially in mature sectors like roads.
9.19 As also highlighted in the Economic Survey 2024-25, public sector efforts alone
cannot meet India’s growing infrastructure requirements. While public investment
remains crucial, a multi-pronged financing approach is essential to attract the
requisite investments from the private sector and long-term institutional investors.
This strategy requires strengthening resource mobilisation across all levels through
innovative measures, including viable user charges and empowering municipal bodies
to float bonds for localised resource generation. It also involves accelerating private
participation including through public-private partnerships (PPPs). A wider array of
PPP models with nuanced risk-sharing, right-price infrastructure services and a pipeline
of bankable projects can facilitate infrastructure development significantly. Improved
project preparation, standardised contracts and dispute resolution mechanisms are
also critical to sustaining investor confidence and scaling PPPs.

efficiency and technological integration. Over the past decade, sustained investment
and policy reforms have significantly expanded the National Highway (NH) network
and improved construction pace, laying a stronger foundation for multimodal
connectivity and economic integration (Chart IX.5 to Chart IX.8). For FY26, 10,000 km
of construction is targeted, of which 4,938 km have been completed as of 31 December

Box IX.3: Key Initiatives and Reforms in the Roadways & Highways Sector
High Speed Connectivity and Urban Integration:
• High-Speed Corridor (HSC) Development: To align freight speeds with global
benchmarks, the HSC network expanded from 550 km in 2014 to 5,364 km by December
2025. A total network of approximately 26,000 km is targeted by FY33, with 9,366 km
currently under implementation.8
• Economic Node Connectivity: Priority is accorded to highway projects linking ports,
Inland Water Transport (IWT) terminals, and industrial corridors to lower logistics
costs.
• Urban Decongestion: A new policy for access-controlled ring roads and bypasses
has been finalised for cities with populations over 1 lakh. This employs innovative cost-
sharing models, such as land pooling and value capture, to transform urban centres into
growth engines.
Privatisation and Asset Monetisation Roadmap:
• Public InvIT: The first Public InvIT is planned for launch in 2026. This follows a
successful cumulative monetisation of ₹1.52 lakh crore through ToT and private InvITs.
• Project Pipeline: In line with the Budget announcement FY26, a dedicated PPP
pipeline of 13,400 km (estimated cost of ₹8.3 lakh crore) has been identified for
development over the next three years.
Reforms for improving Project Quality:
• Project Preparation: Fixed-cost bidding and introduction of performance rating as
part of bid evaluation.
• Construction: Stricter eligibility norms, Additional Performance Security for low bids
and introducing contractor performance rating.
• Use of Technology: Mandated use of drone surveys for alignment planning,
deployment of Automated Intelligent Machine-Aided Construction (AIMC), and the
use of pre-cast components for non-critical items mandated for projects above ₹300
crores. Additionally, a Drone Analytics Monitoring System has been introduced for
encroachment, along with AI-based detection of potholes and cracks using network
survey vehicles.
9.21 Within the broader infrastructure landscape, rural roads development has played
a critical role in improving last-mile connectivity and rural integration. The Pradhan
Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has achieved near-universal rural connectivity,
with over 99.7 per cent of eligible habitations connected, as of 31 December 2025.9 The
8 ibid.

349
349Economic Survey 2025-26
programme has been strengthened through focused initiatives, including a dedicated
road connectivity vertical under PM-JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya
Maha Abhiyan) to serve Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PTVGs), targeting 8,000
km of roads over the period 2023-28. As of 31 December 2025, 2,495 roads (7,323.96
km of road length) and 163 bridges have been sanctioned under PM-JANMAN for
connecting 2,909 habitations, out of which 248 roads (1242.41 km of road length) has
been completed.10
9.22 Further momentum has been reinforced through PMGSY-IV, launched in
September 2024, which aims to connect 25,000 unconnected habitations by constructing
or upgrading 62,500 km of roads and bridges at an estimated cost of ₹70,125 crore
during FY25–FY29. The phase adopts international standards, GIS-based surveys, and
the PM GatiShakti framework, while converging with the Dharti Abha–Janjatiya Gram
Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA-JGUA) scheme to prioritise habitations with high Scheduled
Tribes population. So far, 2,490 roads (8,655.378 km of road length) and 01 bridge
have been sanctioned under PMGSY-IV, which will provide connectivity to 2,734 new
habitations.
9.23 Outlook: India’s roads and highways sector is moving from rapid network
expansion towards greater logistics efficiency and quality. Sustained capital
investment, expansion of high-speed corridors, multimodal integration under PM
GatiShakti and reforms in project delivery are strengthening capacity and reliability.
This infrastructure-led push is central for reducing logistics costs, easing congestion
and improving connectivity.
Railways
9.24 Indian Railways continue to play a pivotal role in India’s infrastructure landscape
by expanding network capacity, modernising assets, and strengthening multimodal
connectivity. As of March 2025, the rail network has expanded to 69,439 Rkm. During
FY26, it is targeted to extend the network further by 3,500 km. Electrification has
reached 99.1 per cent of the network by October 2025.11 Sustained investments have
enabled faster network expansion, with commissioning rates more than doubling in the
post-2014 period compared to the previous decade (Chart IX.9).

9.25 A defining feature of recent years has been the record capital expenditure on
railway infrastructure, with a focus on new lines, doubling and multi-tracking, rolling
stock augmentation, signalling, and safety-related works. In FY26 (BE), capital outlay
has been maintained at historically high levels, to accelerate capacity creation in a time
bound manner (Chart IX.10).
9.26 Railways have also emerged as a backbone of India’s freight and energy logistics,
supporting coal movement, industrial supply chains, and containerised traffic through
dedicated corridors, modern terminals, and first-mile connectivity projects. Parallel
investments in stations, signalling, telecom and digital systems are improving network
reliability, safety, and user experience (Box IX.4).
Box IX.4: Key Infrastructure Initiatives in the Railways Sector
• Economic Railway Corridors (PM GatiShakti): Three corridor programmes—
Energy, Mineral & Cement; Port Connectivity; and High Traffic Density routes—are
being implemented to strengthen multimodal connectivity and logistics efficiency. 434
projects with an outlay of ₹11.17 lakh crore have been identified under three corridors
and mapped on the PM GatiShakti portal. Of these, 122 projects covering 12,150 km
have been sanctioned, and 198 projects spanning 19,779 km are under different stages
of appraisal.
• Major ongoing projects:
 Mumbai–Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR): Over 55 per cent physical
progress has been achieved as on October 2025, with land acquisition completed
and most civil packages awarded, marking a major step towards introducing high-
speed rail infrastructure in India.
 Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs): About 2,741 km (96.4 per cent) of the
2,843 km DFC network has been commissioned as of October 2025, with the Eastern
351
351Economic Survey 2025-26
DFC (1,337 km) fully completed and 1,404 km of the 1,506 km Western DFC completed.
These corridors are easing congestion on the passenger network, significantly reducing
freight transit times and contributing to lowering logistics costs.
• Station Redevelopment: Under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme, 1,337 stations have
been identified for phased redevelopment, with works completed at select stations and
progress underway across the country to improve capacity, accessibility and multimodal
integration. Further, 15 stations have been identified to develop/redevelop on PPP
mode.
• Safety & Technology Upgradation: Large-scale deployment of Kavach [Advance
Train Protection (ATP) System], electronic interlocking, automatic block signalling, and
track renewal are enhancing network safety and throughput.
• Track upgradation: More than 78 per cent of railway tracks have been upgraded for
sectional speed of 110 kmph and above.
• Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs): 18 projects worth ₹16,636 crore have been
completed and seven projects worth ₹16,334 crore are under implementation as on
September 2025.12
9.27 Outlook: Indian Railways is undergoing a transformation, driven by sustained
capital investment, rapid network expansion, near-universal electrification and a
corridor-based approach to capacity creation. Continued focus on dedicated freight
corridors, economic rail corridors under PM GatiShakti, and modern signalling and
station infrastructure is improving throughput, reliability and multimodal integration.
These infrastructure-led initiatives will be central for reducing logistics costs, and
strengthening connectivity.
Civil Aviation
9.28 India has emerged as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market. The
number of airports increased from 74 in 2014 to 164 in 2025.13 In FY25, Indian airports
handled 412 million passengers, and the same is projected to increase to 665 million by
FY31. Further, air cargo volume grew from 2.53 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY15
to 3.72 MMT in FY25, and 2.95 MMT handled in FY26 (until December), driven by
several key policy initiatives and reforms (Box IX.5).14

Box IX.5: Key policy initiatives driving civil aviation growth
• Regional Connectivity Scheme- Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (RCS-UDAN):
Operationalisation of 657 routes connecting 93 airports, including heliports and water
aerodromes, has made air travel affordable while improving access to remote and
aspirational regions. Further, the modified UDAN Scheme has been announced to
increase regional connectivity to 120 new destinations and cater to 4 crore passengers
over the next 10 years.
• Greenfield Airports Policy: In-principle approval for 24 Greenfield airports, with
13 already operational airports, including the Navi Mumbai International Airport, is
expanding urban and regional capacity.
• Airport Modernisation & Capacity Expansion: Since FY20, modernisation
projects at several airports across the country have successfully raised combined
passenger-handling capacity of operational airports to approximately 575 million
passengers per annum.
• Digital & Technological Initiatives: Expansion of Digi Yatra, liberalised drone
regulations, PLI support for drone manufacturing, and focus on Advanced Air Mobility
(AAM) have been ongoing.
• Legislative Reforms:
 The Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024, replacing the Aircraft Act, 1934, aims
to modernize India’s aviation sector by enhancing safety, innovation, growth, and
global compliance.

9.29 Outlook: India’s civil aviation sector is on a sustained growth trajectory,
supported by a conducive policy environment, rising demand and steady infrastructure
expansion. While the sector remains sensitive to global economic cycles and the
need for continuous capacity upgradation, the current passenger volumes represent
only a fraction of India’s potential. Further, India currently operates approximately
0.11 airports per million people, significantly lower than the US (47.35) and China
(0.39)15, signalling substantial headroom for further growth. Expansion in India’s
airport and air navigation infrastructure and a growing ancillary ecosystem, including
Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) and leasing, are strengthening the sector.
These developments, along with technology integration, positions civil aviation as a key
driver of nationwide economic connectivity and integration.
Ports and Shipping
9.30 India’s maritime sector has undergone significant modernisation and is emerging
as an essential pillar of logistics competitiveness, industrial growth and global supply-
chain integration. Under Maritime India Vision 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision
2047, substantial progress has been made in upgrading port infrastructure, enhancing
regulatory frameworks, improving operational efficiency, and increasing private sector
participation.
9.31 India’s ports have demonstrated strong growth momentum, driven by
accelerated capacity creation and a substantial increase in cargo throughput (Chart
IX.13). Furthermore, mechanisation, smart port initiatives, and digital trade facilitation
have significantly improved operational efficiency across major ports, with the average
container vessel turnaround time achieving near-global best standards (Chart IX.14).
India's growing competitiveness is reflected in global rankings, with two Indian ports
now featuring among the top 30 and seven among the top 100 in the World Bank’s
Container Port Performance Index 2024. Recent legislative reforms in the ports and
shipping sector may be seen at Box IX.6.
15 Airport density figures are calculated based on the total number of operational airports (commercial and general
aviation) as reported in the CIA World Factbook 2025 and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Data
Plus (2025 estimates), divided by the mid-year population projections from the World Bank Open Data 2025.
High values for the USA (~47 per million) reflect a mature market with a high concentration of general aviation
and municipal airfields (over 15,000). For India, the focus is primarily on commercial hubs and regional airports
under active development schemes, indicating significant structural headroom for future expansion.

9.32 India has further strengthened the landlord port model16 to catalyse private
investments in port development and operations. This strategic shift is evident in the
substantial growth of PPP projects. The number of PPP projects awarded rose from
37 in FY15 to 87 in FY25, with the total value of PPP projects increasing from ₹16,180
crore to ₹61,029 crore, reflecting a 377 per cent rise. Currently, 57 operational PPP
projects valued at ₹42,235 crore have increased port capacity by approximately 660
MTPA.
9.33 Outlook: PPP and captive operators are projected to handle 80 per cent of
all cargo at major ports by 2030. A pipeline of 48 PPP projects worth approximately
₹23,000 crore (excluding the Development of Vadhvan Port Project of worth ₹76,220
crore) has been identified for the next five years (FY26 to FY31). These projects will
further enhance the capacity and efficiency of India's Major Ports.17
Box IX.6: Recent Legislative Reforms in Ports and Shipping Sector

5,155 km, with cargo operations on 29 NWs, cruise operations on 15 NWs, and passenger
services on 23 NWs; 11 NWs support all three modes, reflecting strong multimodal
integration. Cargo movement through Inland Water Transport (IWT) has also risen
significantly from 18 MMT in 2013-2014 to 146 MMT in 2024-2025, driven by several
reforms and key projects in the sector (Box IX.7). Passenger movement has grown to
7.6 crore in 2024-25 from 1.61 crore in 2023-24.

Box IX.8: Urban Water Transport: Kochi Water
Metro as a Scalable Model
The Kochi Water Metro (KWM), operational since 2023, represents a landmark shift in
India’s urban mobility by re-establishing inland waterways as a sustainable mass transit
option. The project is institutionalised through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) incorporated
in 2021, with the Government of Kerala holding 74 per cent equity and Kochi Metro Rail
Limited (KMRL) holding the remaining 26 per cent. KMRL itself is a joint venture between
the Government of India and the Government of Kerala.18
The project entails a planned network of 15 routes covering approximately 78 km,
connecting 10 islands through 38 modern terminals and jetties. With a total project cost of
about ₹819 crore, financing includes an €85 million long-term concessional loan from the
German development bank KfW under the Indo-German Financial Cooperation framework,
complemented by state government support.19

357Economic Survey 2025-26
A defining feature of KWM is its deployment of air-conditioned electric-hybrid ferries
designed and built by Cochin Shipyard Limited following a global tender. Each vessel carries
around 100 passengers and is powered by lithium titanate oxide (LTO) batteries, enabling
rapid charging and high cycle life. The terminals are designed with universal accessibility
standards, and the service is fully integrated with the Kochi Metro Rail system through unified
digital ticketing and interoperable smart cards, enabling seamless multimodal travel. As of
2025, cumulative ridership has crossed five million passengers, with island communities
such as Vypin, Bolgatty, and Mattancherry experiencing improved connectivity to the urban
core.20
From a cost-effectiveness perspective, water metros offer a significant advantage over
rail-based systems by leveraging existing waterways and minimising land acquisition
and elevated infrastructure. Estimates suggest that a 75 km water metro network can be
developed at roughly one-tenth the cost of a comparable elevated metro corridor, making it
an attractive option for suitable urban geographies. However, scalability remains contingent
on hydrological suitability, assured year-round navigability, availability of electric or
alternative-fuel vessels, and coordinated financing across multiple levels of government.
The success of the KWM serves as a scalable model for other Indian cities with navigable water
bodies, potentially offering sustainable and efficient transportation options.21 The model is
being replicated in 21 cities, with feasibility studies in several cities in process, including
Ayodhya, Dhubri, Goa, Guwahati, Kollam, Kolkata, Prayagraj, Patna, Srinagar, Varanasi,
Mumbai, Vasai, Mangalore (Gurupura River), Gandhinagar-Ahmedabad (Sabarmati River),
Alleppey in Kerala, as well as Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.22
Overall, the Kochi Water Metro demonstrates how institutional innovation, green
technology, and multimodal integration can convert natural water assets into efficient
urban infrastructure. While replication must remain context-specific and demand-driven,
the model provides a credible template for sustainable urban transport in India’s riverine
and coastal cities.
9.35 Outlook: India aims to increase the Inland Water Transport modal share from
2 per cent to 5 per cent and raise cargo traffic to 200+ MMT by 2030 and 500 MMT by
2047 under the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision.
9.36 Shipbuilding: In September 2025, the Government of India approved a
comprehensive package of ₹69,725 crore (approximately USD 8.3 billion) to revitalise
the country’s shipbuilding and maritime ecosystem. The initiative adopts a four-
pillar approach aimed at developing a globally competitive, technologically advanced
and sustainable maritime sector. Key policy initiatives and achievements driving the
maritime transformation are elaborated in Box IX.9.
