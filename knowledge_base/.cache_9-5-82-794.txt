Introduction
Vishwavidyalaya, Raipur,
Chhattisgarh, India Climate change has resulted in increased average temperatures, extended periods of drought
or heavy rainfall, and the appearance of new pests and diseases, all of which negatively
affect agricultural productivity in Southeast and South Asia. (Rosenzweig, et al. 2001) [9].
Protected cultivation is a high-technology approach to crop production that involves growing
plants in controlled environments protected from unfavorable weather conditions. This is
achieved through the use of advanced structures such as polyhouses, net houses, screen
houses, and tunnels, as well as protective measures like windbreaks, irrigation, and
mulching. This method is more sustainable than traditional open-field farming because it
minimizes the impact of climate variability by regulating the environment and allows for
more efficient use of inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, and water. Protected cultivation has
the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lessen the environmental footprint of
food production. However, activities such as heating, artificial lighting, post-harvest
transportation, packaging, and fertilizer use in high-tech greenhouses remain significant
environmental challenges. Here is a paraphrased version of the given paragraph: Protected
