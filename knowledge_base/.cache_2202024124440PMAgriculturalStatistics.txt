***INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW
Rajasthan is predominantly agrarian state. Water resources being scarce,
agriculture is essentially rain fed and continues to be susceptible to the
vagaries of monsoon. The geographical area of 342.24 lakh hectares makes
this State the largest in the country.
The Agricultural sector continues to play a dominant and vital role in the
Indian Economy by contributing to a sizeable share in the National product
absorbing a bulk of the economic activity pursued by majority of the
population. In this context of primacy of Agriculture, timely and reliable
statistics on crop production is of vital importance and significance. Crop
production has two major components viz. Area sown and Average yield
rate.
The Directorate of Economics and Statistics (D.E.S) release estimates of
Area, Production and Yield in respect of principal crops of food grains,
oilseeds, and other important crops. The estimates of area and yield rates
assume prime importance in the entire gamut of agricultural statistics.
Statistics of Land use and area under crop are obtained as by-product of
land revenue administration in respect of the land record of State.
The estimates of crop production are obtained by multiplying the area
estimates with the corresponding yield estimates. The yield estimates of
major crops are obtained from scientifically planned crop cutting
experiments conducted under the programme of Crop Estimation Surveys
(CES). Under the programme of CES, data on yield rates are collected
through crop cutting experiments by using statistical techniques of random
sampling.
iLAND USE STATISTICS
Land Use Statistics are built up as a part of The Land record maintained by
the revenue agencies (Board of Revenue, Rajasthan). Land Use Statistics
collected on complete enumeration. The Land Use pattern during 2020-21 and
2021-22 presented in following table:

iiDistribution of Land Use:
Reporting Area for Land Utilization:
The reporting area stands for the area for which data on land use
classification of area are available i.e. the reporting area is the area
according to village papers prepared by the revenue employees. It has been
classified into nine categories of Land Use.
Forests:
Forests represent all actually forested area including all land classified as
forests under any legal enactment dealing with forests or administered as
forests, whether state owned or private and whether wooded or maintained
as potential forest land. The forest area of the State during 2021-22 is
27.78 lakh hectares accounting for 8.10 percent of the total reporting area
of the state.
Land put to non-Agricultural Uses:
This stands for all lands occupied by building, roads, pathway, social
forests, bus stands and railways, under water i.e. rivers, canals, marshy,
water logged areas, land under still water and other land put to uses other
than agriculture. The area under this category is 20.31 lakh hectares
accounting for 5.92 percent of the total reporting area in the state during
2021-22 as against 20.10 lakh hectare in 2020-21, recording an increase
of 1.05 percent.
Barren and Un- culturable Land:
This covers all barren and unculturable land like mountains, deserts, hills
etc. Land which cannot be brought under cultivation unless at a high cost
shall be classified as uncultivable. An extent of 23.66 lakh hectare of land
comes under Barren and Uncultivable Land which represents 6.90 percent
of the total reporting area in the State during 2021-22.
Permanent Pastures and other Grazing Land:
This covers all grazing land, whether they are permanent pastures or
meadows are considered as permanent pastures and other grazing land.
Village common grazing lands are included under this head. An extent of
16.55 lakh hectare which represents 4.83 percent of the total reporting
iiiarea in the State during 2021-22 is under permanent pastures and other
grazing land.
Miscellaneous Tree Crops and Groves not including in the Net Area
Sown:
Under this class, all cultivable land which is not included under net area
sown but is put to some agricultural use is included. Land under caesarian
trees, thatching grass, bamboo bushes and other groves for fuel etc. which
are not included under orchards shall be included under this category. An
extent under this category was 0.29 lakh hectare which represent 0.08
percent of the total reporting area in the State during 2021-22.
Culturable Waste land:
Culturable waste land include all lands available for cultivation whether
not taken up for cultivation or taken up for cultivation once but not
cultivated during the current year and last five years or more in succession
for one reason or other are classified as culturable waste. It formed 10.73
percent (36.80 lakh hectare) of the total reporting area in the State during
2021-22.
Other Fallow lands:
This implies all lands, which were taken up for cultivation but are
temporarily out of cultivation for a period not less than a year and not
more than five years. An extent under this category was 20.40 lakh
hectares which is 5.95 percent of the total reporting area in the State
during 2021-22.
Current Fallow:
This class comprises of cropped areas, which are kept fallow during the
current year. If any, seeding area is not cropped in the current year, it may
be treated as current fallow. The area under current fallow during 2021-22
was 15.85 lakh hectares as against 16.75 lakh hectare in 2020-21 showing
a decrease of 5.37 percent.
ivGross Area Sown:
Gross Area Sown presents total area cultivated under all food and non-food
crops, including the area sown more than once during the agricultural
year. The gross area sown or gross cropped area during 2021-22 is 274.42
lakh hectare as against 261.00 lakh hectare in 2020-21, recording an
increase of 5.14 percent.
Net Area Sown:
Net Area Sown represents total area sown with the crops and orchards
counting area sown more than once in the same year once only. The Net
Area Sown during 2021-22 was 181.30 lakh hectares which represent
52.87 percent of total reporting area as against 179.48 lakh hectare in
2020-21 showing an increase of 1.01 percent.
Area Sown More Than Once:
Area on which crops are cultivated more than once during the agricultural
year 2021-22 was 93.12 lakh hectare or 27.16 percent of the total
reporting area in the State.
Irrigation by Sources:
Irrigation is the artificial application of water to the soil for the growth of
plants. Water is an important determinant factor for the production of
crops in the agriculture sector. Intensive and extensive cultivation of land
depend mainly on the availability of water. At present, less than one fourth
of the State’s area is under irrigation. The main sources of irrigation in
Rajasthan are canals, tanks, tube-wells and wells. The Net area irrigated
by all sources during 2021-22 was 89.24 lakh hectares as against 87.78
lakh hectare in 2020-21 showing a increase of 1.66 percent. The net
irrigated area during 2021-22 constituted 49.22 percent of net area sown
in the state. Sri Ganganagar District is at the top with 6.62 lakh hectare
net irrigated area sown. However the highest percentage of the net area
irrigated to the net area sown was recorded in Kota District with 96.79
vpercent whereas the lowest percentage was recorded in the Barmer District
with 18.26 percent. The following table shows the Net area irrigated year
2021-22 by various sources compared with year 2020-21.

CROPPING PATTERN:
Cropping pattern refers to the proportionate area under different crops
during an agricultural year. Cereals and pulses constitute food grain crops.
In Rajasthan, Bajra in Kharif and Wheat in Rabi season are the major food
grain crops. Non-food crops constitute oilseed, fibers, tobacco, dyes, fodder
crops. The gross cropped area under all crops increased to 274.42 lakh
hectares during 2021-22 from 261.00 lakh hectares in 2020-21, showing
an increase of 5.14 percent. The following table shows the cropping pattern

During the year 2021-22 the production of food grain was 231.92 lakh M.T.
as against 273.24 lakh M.T. in 2020-21. Wheat (47.91 percent) and Bajra
(18.60 percent) are major component of the total food grain production in
the state (as sown in the chart below).
xvCOMPONENTS OF FOODGRAINS IN 2021-212
Area statistics are collected on complete enumeration basis. The second
most important component of production statistics is yield rate. The yield
estimates of major crops are obtained through analysis of scientifically
designed crop cutting experiments (CCE) conducted under general crop
estimation surveys (GCES).
During 2021-22, 239996 such experiments were planned. At present
more than 90% of the production of food grain is estimated on the basis of
yield rates obtained from the CCE’S.
The primary objective of GCE’s is to obtain fairly reliable estimates of
average yield of principal food & non food crops for each district which are
important from the point of view of crop production. The estimates of yield
rates thus arrived at are generally adopted from the purposes of planning,
policy formulation and implementation. The CCE’s consist of identification
xviand marking of experimental plots of a specified size and shape in the
selected field on the principle of random sampling, threshing the produce &
recording of the harvested produce for determining the percentage recovery
of dry grains or the marketable form of the produce.
Crop wise details of experiments planned, experiments analyzed and yield
rate under GCE’s during 2021-22 are given in following table.
