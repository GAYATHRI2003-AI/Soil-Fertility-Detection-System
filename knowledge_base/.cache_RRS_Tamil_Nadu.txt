Soil is a key part of our natural environment and is a non-renewable resource. Soil loss due to erosion can have
major implications not just for soils and the benefits they provide but also for air and water quality as well as our climate,
biodiversity and economy. The acquisition of adequate information on soil and land characteristics is thus essential to
formulate a viable strategy to check the degradation of soil and land resources Proper consideration of soils through the
planning system is needed to make sure that soils can deliver essential functions vital for the sustainability of Indian
environment and economy.
Soil and Land Use survey of India (SLUSI), Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare,
Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare carried out Rapid Reconnaissance Survey (RRS) to identify & demarcate
the potential soil erosion in river catchment of different river basins using extensive ground truthing. The details on
various facets of soil & land have been assessed to fix sub /micro watershed wise priority in catchments based on the
assessed runoff using SYI/RPI index. The work for data acquisition on RRS has been completed by organization in 2010.
Subsequently SLUSI took up a national initiative to digitize the RRS maps and data on soils of the country at 1:50, 000
in different states.
With a view to provide details to users in various states, SLUSI took up the initiative to seamlessly compile the
digital soil & land character data base acquired on 1:50 scale during the decades. This state-level RRS guide contains
agro-climatic sub-zone wise information on various soil parameters such as landscape, physiography, slope, depth,
texture and erosion status.
The digital soil database can be vital input as considered in the National Disaster Management Plan and State
Disaster Management plan of Tamil Nadu, which recognizes soil as a physical asset and highlight the need to manage
our finite soil resource by maintaining and improving its condition.
The spatial database would play an effective role to support the decision makers to achieve the right development
in the right place and identifies the need to consider the implications of development on soil quality as one of its guiding
principles.
This enormous task is accomplished by officers and officials of Soil and Land Use Survey of India. I hope that
the RRS guide may serve as a guiding tool for user’s departments /agencies of the state.

OVERVIEW
1. Prelude
The purpose of planning is to manage the development and use of land in long term public interest. Soil is a key part of
our environment and is effectively a non-renewable resource. Soil loss due to erosion can have major implications not just for
soils and the benefits they provide but also for air and water quality as well as our climate, biodiversity and economy. Proper
consideration of soils through the planning system is needed to make sure that soils can deliver essential functions vital for the
sustainability of Indian environment and economy.
The National disaster management plan (NPF) and Disaster Management plan of Tamil Nadu state recognize soil as a
physical asset and highlight the need to manage our finite soil resource by maintaining and improving its condition.
The acquisition of adequate information on soil and land characteristics is thus essential to formulate a viable strategy to
check the degradation of soil and land resources. To combat the situation development of spatial database would play an
effective role to support the decision makers to achieve the right development in the right place and identifies the need to
consider the implications of development on soil quality as one of its guiding principles.
2. Introduction
Soil and Land are important natural resources on the surface of the earth. The biomass covers the surface and act as
natural protector of soil in the area. But due to variety of reasons the vegetative cover distribution varies at various location in
the state. The area in state suffers from a variety of problems of soil erosion, soil salinity, sodicity/ alkalinity, shallow depth,
unfavorable texture responsible for increased land degradation. Tamil Nadu homes over 16% of countries population in an area,
which is 3.96% of TGA of the country. Per Capita arable land in state is around 0.15 ha at present.
There is ever growing need to new Watersheds technology in an integrated watershed management-tool for climate smart
solution in the entire river basin to treat the abiotic or physical component of a river basin including soil and water, and mineral
deposits and other compounds bound up with them. Water is a dynamic resource variable in time and space from season to
season in year, as the status of surface and ground water in a basin area follows a cyclic mode for replenishment and losses. But
in contrast to water, soils formation and development –take place from the physical weathering of parent material (rocks) to
chemical decomposition and biological transformation – is a drawn-out process that may take hundreds or thousands of years
[Jenny, 1994]; and taking into account of time required in the soil development, once formed, soils may be fairly durable if not
conserve it, once it protect from runoff due to precipitation and reduce the severity of related erosion. Thus, changes in a basin’s
water resource status is relatively fast and easily identified, while the soils those changes naturally slow and unnoticed with
significant human activity in many ecosystems (example, in agro-ecosystems and urban ecosystems), and climate change
phenomenon the complexity of human-technology-environment systems has increased manifold [Pahl-Wostl, 2006] resulted in
drastic change in soil quality status that has under gone degradation drastically. Now a days many land degradation problems
are being faced in our country such as salinity / alkalinity and waterlogging in command areas, severe erosion in catchments
leading to siltation of reservoirs, decrease in productivity of crops etc. As both soil and water are operating in ecosystem
synergistically to one another through many biotic and abiotic processes. Being thus interrelated, degradation of either soil or
water has a concurrent effect on the other; hence neither can be considered in isolation
Therefore, in recent years’ emphasis is laid on the information on the nature, extent, spatial distribution and magnitude of
land degradation which plays a vital role in planning the strategies for reclamation /conservation of degrade soil and land
characteristics.
Management of soil and water resources conservation under RVP/FPR catchments is completed by SLUSI to assess the
priority sub/ micro watersheds / Hydrologic unit’s area under various catchments of the state in last three decades on 1: 50,000
scale. In this context mapping of soil and land features as well as land use/cover information, adequate field visit/survey were
carried out for mapping.2
2.1 Objective
The basic objective of the Rapid reconnaissance mapping is to calculate the sediment yield of the catchment and
determine the status of runoff and soil loss in the country on 1:50,000 scale. Generating priority hydrologic units (sub/micro)
level spatial maps based on its assessed erosion through sediment yield potential and generating soil & land information with its
spatial distribution components helps to check soil erosion using conservation measures.
2.2 Background
A national policy was adopted to use watersheds for the development of land and water resources for conservation in all
possible river basins. The selection of watersheds in catchment areas of different river basin for development of water and soil
resources was done on the basis vulnerability assessment of soils for erosion, demographic setting of the area by prioritizing on
problem’s severity. Each priority watershed was surveyed and studied morphologically and topographically to generate
database. The development of Watersheds is applied not only to the geo-physical situation but also to the people’s need.
Watersheds are natural hydrological entities that cover a specific areal expanse of land surface form which the rain fall
runoff flows to a defined drain of channel, stream or river of any particular point. The size of watershed is governed by the size
of the stream/river or the point of intersection on the stream/river like dam/barrage etc. A workable size of watershed is defined
by aims and objectives of the development programs. The size of watersheds will also differ with the different stages between
macro to micro level of planning and implementation of watershed programs. (AIS&LUS, 1990).
The concept of a watershed as the planning unit for the development of land and water resources has been available for
long, but the watershed approach has gained importance since 1974.
The Soil and Land Use Survey of India (SLUSI erstwhile AIS&LUS) has initiated delineation and codification of
hydrologic units in the country, since launching of Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Soil and Water Conservation in the
catchments of River Valley Project during III Five-Year Plan. The delineation of a hydrologic unit is carried out following
hierarchical system of rivers/streams based on drainage network. The codification of hydrologic unit is made to assign a unique
code to all hydrologic units following Alfa-numeric Codification System. The drainage network helps in the delineation of a
watershed for a particular river system.
In an attempt to acquire soil and land resource information at reconnaissance level survey, SLUSI (1991) has developed
and published a methodology to map the potential soil erosion in different river catchment area using extensive ground truthing
method. The organization has carried out Rapid Reconnaissance soil survey to map various facets of soil and land to assess sub
/micro watershed wise priority in catchments of the states based on the assessed runoff using SYI/RPI index and plan to
complete the work of data acquisition by 2012. Subsequently SLUSI (2010) took up a national initiative to digitize the RRS
maps and data on soils of the country at 1:50, 000 in different states.
In recent times, SLUSI took up the initiative to seamlessly compile the digital national soil and land character data base
acquired on 1:50 scale during last three decades. Mapping of natural resources has been an on-going activity for more than
three decades.
2.3 Data Source
2.3.1 Acquisition of soil and land data
The work of mapping of areas in catchment areas was stared in 1985 in the state. The initial mapping of soil and land
characteristics was carried out using Survey of India topographic maps with extensive field ground truthing involving study of
profile/ mini pits and auguring at regular interval.3
The digitalization drive was undertaken by SLUSI in 2010 with NIC to place the soil and land character data on SLUSI
geo portal with Universal Traverse Mercator l (UTM 43 and 44 N) projection. The final outputs were later converted Albers
equal area with following parameters.

For mapping of soil and land characteristics on 1: 50,000 scale, land use/land cover, wetland and wastelands thematic
information’s taken from SOI toposheets was used as base map. Besides this, forest cover map generated by Forest Survey of
India (FSI) was also referred.
The tabular distribution of area details of Geographic / landscape (parent material) and climate data acquired from district
level state government records/ district gazetteer used as reference information while mapping. Apart from this, district
boundary taken from Survey of India topographical maps, meteorological data use to assess the soil loss especially while
mapping of water erosion categories.
2.4 Methodology
The various steps followed in the methodology for mapping RRS on 1:50,000 scale. First of all, we select the area and
estimate the erosion intensity mapping units for Hydrologic unit’s delineation up to sub / micro watersheds and codification
done using Survey of India toposheets. This information was converted to digital layer using DEM downloaded from
BHUVAN. The steps includes were:
 Delineation of catchment areas / bigger hydrologic unit into small watersheds (hereinafter will be called as Sub
watersheds) on 1:50,000 scale topographic maps of Survey of India.
 Codification of different stages of delineation by using Alpha-numeric symbolic code.
 Rapid Reconnaissance survey using 1:50,000 scale topo-maps, satellite imagery/aerial photographs and other basic
material leading to the generation of a map indicating erosion intensity/ runoff potential mapping units.
 Assignment of weightage values to various Erosion Intensity Mapping Units (EIMU) or Run-off Potential Mapping Units
(RPMU) based on their relative Sediment Yield/ Run-off Potential.4
 Assignment of maximum delivery ratios to various Erosion Intensity Mapping Units and assessment of adjusted delivery
ratio for different sub/micro watersheds.
 Computation of Sediment Yield Index / Run off potential Index for individual sub/micro watersheds.
 Grading of sub/micro watersheds into very high, high, medium, low and very low Priority categories.
(Steps sourced from: Methodology of Priority Delineation survey manual published by erstwhile AISLUS in 1991)
2.5 Output
SLUSI carried out detailed study of soils and generate soil database for watershed management and other developmental
aspects in priority areas. The Rapid Reconnaissance survey helps in categorization of the areas in different classes on priority
basis such as very high, high, medium, low and very low. The areas which comes under very high and high priority classes
needs to check the runoff water through applying watershed approach.
SLUSI successfully completed development of state-wise Micro Watershed Atlas of India using 1:50 k scale drainage
map. The organization has also developed Web-enabled Micro Watershed Information system which is in public domain since
December, 2010 (https://slusi.dacnet.nic.in). It provides Micro watershed data & information in a national standardized format
that allows users to search, access, and visualize data and information for planning development of water resource
The reconnaissance level maps at their original scale showing spatial distribution of site features such as land scape,
physiography, slope, land use and soil characteristics namely colour, texture class, soil erosion status for indicating soil loss,
surface conditions and management also provided as thematic service available on https://slusi.dacnet.nic.in
The Tamil Nadu soil attribute and priority survey maps provide useful background information on the types and
properties of soils at regional scales. The more detailed Soil map of area can be accessed from detailed Soil Survey data.5
HYDROLOGIC FRAMEWORK OF WATERSHED
The digital spatial distribution land features such as landscape/parent material, physiography, slope, land use prevalent
during the time mapped with soil morphological characteristics such as soil depth, texture, erosion are the most important
physical health status indicators required in planning of area, hydrologically or district wise.
SLUSI has developed the model for fixing priority areas based on relative assessment of vulnerability of soils to erosion.
This has been done on sub/micro watershed wise in different catchments of the state. The Region, Basin, Catchment and Sub-
catchment wise distribution with number of Watersheds, Sub-watersheds and Micro-watersheds and their total area presented in

OUTCOMES OF SOIL AND LAND DATABASE
The management of sub/micro watersheds on priority wise in phased manner have been taken up on the analysis of
acquired soil and land parameters collected through Rapid Reconnaissance Soil Survey of the state. The outcomes such as
Landscape/parent material, Soil erosion, Depth, Slope class, Land use and Soil texture brought out during the survey. These
database can be used as a baseline for the development of soil and land quality in the state.
I. Landscape/ Parent Material
The geological formation of India is diverse, ranges from oldest Archean rocks to the recent Alluvium. The major
geological formation in the peninsula consists of Archean rocks comprising Gneiss, Schist, Igneous and Metamorphic rocks.
Western and Central India are covered by lava flows of the Deccan trap. A close relation exists between soil and physiography,
the diversities in physiography, climate and landscapes have enhanced the formation of widely diverse soils in India.
The tabular distribution of landscapes in the state are furnished gives account of landscape in different agro climatic sub zones.
These are seven subzones and it is observed that the effect of these zones on the soil development having identical landscape is
varying as every zone is having unique climatic features with respect to total rainfall, temperatures, and vegetation which
directly governs the soil development. This grouping not only helps in identifying the natures of soil type in different zones
under same landscape/parent material but its capacity to grow different crops/orchards etc.
Based on soil conditions, irrigation, cropping pattern, rainfall distribution and other ecological & social characteristics,
the state is falling under 7 agro-climatic sub zones exhibiting different geological formations namely, Aeolian, Alluvium,
Charnokite, Coastal Alluvium, Granite, Granite Gneiss, Laterite, Limestone and Sandstone. Out of these Seven (07) sub-zones,
maximum area of 33,26,724 ha. is under Southern zone covering districts Dindigul, Kaniyakumari, Madurai, Ramanathapuram,
Sivaganga, Teni, Triunelveli, Tuticorin and Virudhnagar followed by Northeatsern zone with an area of 30,77,652 ha covering
districts Cuddalore, Kanchipuram, Tiruvannamala, Vellore, Villupuram, Chennai and Trivallur. Third highest area is under
Cauvery Delta zone with an area of 23,84,060 ha. covering districts Pudukkotai, Thanjavur, Tiruchchirappli, Ariyalur, Karur,
Nagapattinum, Peramballur and Thiruvarur. Then under Northwestern zone having 18,30,759 ha area covering under Namakal,
Salem, Dharampuri and Krishnagiri districts; Western zone with an area of 12,92,614 ha covering districts Coimbatore,
Dindigul, Erode and Karur; High altitude and hilly zone with an area of 9,97,039 ha covering districts Kaniyakumari, Madurai,
Teni, Triunelveli, Virudhnagar, Dindigul, Coimbatore, Niligiri, Trivallur and Vellore. Least area of 1,08,495 ha is under high
rainfall area covering only one district Kaniyakumari.

II. Soil Erosion
Two types of erosion occur in nature which as follows. Most part of the state suffers from (i) water erosion, whereas (ii)
wind erosion noticed in Coastal-Aeolian landscape, Water erosion on agricultural lands takes place through rain water. Intensity
of rainfall by rain drops create a pressure and finally make an impact on the surface soil. Soil surface condition and water
infiltration depends on the properties of soil surface, part of the water received as precipitation percolate into the soil and
remaining water lost by runoff. Evidently surface runoff is negligible wherever water infiltration. On the basis of soil particles
disintegration from soil surface water erosion classified as splash, sheet, rill and gully erosion.
The effects of water erosion which are interrelated are briefly as follows (i) loss of surface soil (ii) loss of rain water (iii)
loss of soil nutrients and (iv) exposure of less fertile sub soil. A time period an extreme situation create ultimately soil become
unproductive.
Wind Erosion is also a serious problem which adversely affect the soil productivity of agricultural lands. It is responsible
for removal of the top fertile soil and depletion in the soil water content. There are three types which affect the soil movement
viz. saltation surface creep and suspension. Thematic map of spatial distribution of soil erosion and their area shown in figure
no. 3 and table. 2.

Sub zone I: -Cauvery Delta Zone: Erosion is the process that transforms soil into sediment and its deposited into coastal
areas where lands of plain to nearly level slope class are dominant. The severity of erosion got reduced in these plain areas
known as River Delta. In Cauvery delta zone, six erosion classes have identified in state. Majority of the area comes under none
to slight sheet erosion followed by moderate intensity sheet and rill erosion. Whereas moderate to severe erosion, and severe
rills and gully erosion noticed in stream and river banks affecting about 7 % area of zone. It is mainly ascribed to fact that speed
of water flux is reduced due to reducing the slope in delta region which increase sediment deposition. The density of forest
vegetation also affects the severity of erosion. In deciduous dense forest none to slight erosion covers maximum area followed
by slight to moderate and moderate sheet & rill erosion.

Sub zone II: -High Altitude and hilly zone: Seven erosion classes were found in the area in which none to slight sheet
erosion class covers maximum area, followed by slight to moderate sheet and rills erosion, Moderate rills erosion, moderate to
severe rills and gully erosion, severe gully erosion, severe to very severe gully and ravines erosion. The area also witnessed
severe water erosion to severe wind erosion respectively. Altitude is directly associated with the slope, type of vegetation and
depth of soils, if altitude is high the slope also increases and depth of the soil get reduced. This study confirms that deep to very
deep soils covers largest area due to tropical climatic conditions. The temperature is very high and the range of annual
temperature is minimum. These conditions enhance the weathering of rocks. Type and density of vegetation also controls soil
erosion. In Tamil Nadu state mainly broad leaves forest vegetation are observed in the zone, which forms a dense cover on the
soil surface and protect soils from erosion hazards. The vegetation reduces the intensity of gravitation force which creates by
rain drops.

Sub zone VI: -Southern Zone: Southern zone have dominated by laterite landscape, whereas majority of soils comes under
deep to very deep soil class followed by moderately deep soils which are moderately fine to moderately coarse in texture. The
moderately coarse texture enhances the infiltration rate which reduces the overflow of surface water. Due to decreasing the
overflow water flux intensity also slow which reduce the soil erosion. The southern zone affected by none to slight erosion
which covers highest area followed by slight to moderate erosion, moderate erosion moderate to severe erosion and severe
erosion.
