1Classification of Agro-ecological zones:
The Agricultural regions, Forest Regions and the Livestock rearing zones are fully controlled by a set of
inter-related geographic factors. They are:
a) Climatic factors
b) Soil properties and
c) Physiographic settings( topography & drainage).
Based on these three major parameters , the land area of India is classified into several classes of regions
and sub-regions. The Length of Growing Period (LGP) of crops vary depending upon these factors and
also the genetic characteristics of crops grown. LGP is related to the moisture availability to the crops
grown which is controlled by those three major factors of agriculture.
Agro-ecological zone is a land unit, carved out of climatic zone, correlated with landforms, climate and
the length of growing period (LGP). LGP refers to the number of days available for crop growth with
suitable conditions.
Agro-Ecological zoning is the process of correlating the units of physiography, bioclimate, soilscapes
and the length of growing period. Each one of these aspects have a very wide number of classess and
subdivisions.
As we have seen that the Indian sub-continent exhibits a variety of landscapes and climatic conditions
which are noticeable in the types of soils and vegetation.
In the past, several attempts have been made to understand and classify the agro-climatic regions as well
as the agro-ecological regions of India.
The Planning Commission of India, divided the country into 15 broad agro-climatic zones based on
physiography and climate. This we have seen as the first part of this lesson.
Based on the four parameters which have been explained so far,
a) physiographic features,
b) Soil characteristics,
c) Bio-climatic features,
d) the Length of growing period, the land area of India is divided into 20 agro-ecological regions.
They are the following:
1. Cold Arid Eco-region with Shallow Skeletal Soils
2. Hot Arid Eco-region with Desert and Saline Soils
3. Hot Arid Eco-region with Red and Black Soils
4. Hot Semi-Arid Eco-region with Alluvium Derived soils
5. Hot Semi Arid Eco-region with Medium and Deep Black Soils
6. Hot Semi-Arid Eco-region with Shallow and Medium (Dominant) Black Soils
7. Hot Semi Arid Eco-region with Red and Bla6k soils
8. Hot Semi-Arid Eco-region with Red Loamy soils
9. Hot subbumid (Dry) Eco-region with Alluvium- Derived Soils
10. Hot Subhumid Eco-region with Red and Black Soils
11. Hot Subhumid Eco-region with Red and Yellow Soils
12. Hot Subhumid Eco-region with Red and Lateritic soils
213. Hot Suhhumid (Moist) Eco-region with Alluvium-derived soils
14. Warm Subhumid to Humid with Inclusion of Perhumid Eco-region with Brown Forest and
Podzolic Soils
15. Hot Subhumid (moist) to Humid (inclusion) of perhumid Eco-region with alluvium-derived soils
16. Warm Perhumid Eco-region with Brown and Red Hill Soils
17. Warm Perhumid Eco-region with Red and Lateritc Soils
18. Hot Subhumid to Semi-arid Eco-region with Coastal Alluvium-derived soils
19. Hot Humid Pemhumid Eco-region with Red, Lateritic and Alluvium-derived soils
20. Hot Humid/Perhumid Island Eco-region with Red loamy and Sandy Soils .
