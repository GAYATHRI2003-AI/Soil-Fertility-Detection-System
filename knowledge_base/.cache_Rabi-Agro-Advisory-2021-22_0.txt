Agriculture, which is the primary driver of rural economy
providing food security to the country and employment to 58 percent of
the population, continued to grow at an steady rate during the Covid-19
Pandemic wave. Agriculture could perform well because of policy
interventions, timely agro-advisories and farmers’ commitment along
with good monsoon and cheaper and higher availability of labour, This
has reflected on the GDP, the agricultural economy grew significantly by
3.4 percent. During 2020-21, the food grain production in the country
has reached the milestone of 308.65 million tons with record production
of paddy, wheat and pulses. Accomplishing a record of 25.72 million
tons of pulse production entails the story of pulses revolution in the
country. However, for many commodities, impetus on adoption of latest
farming practices and technology up-gradation at the grass roots level
in different regions is required.
Positive indications in oilseeds production i.e. 36.10 million tons
in 2020-21 are the outcome of policy interventions, scientific approaches
for Lab to Land and development initiatives. The Indian agriculture has
to move towards diversification with focus on processing and value
addition, and robust marketing system. The yield gaps and production
gaps need to be bridged. Therefore, promoting best agricultural practices
for enhancing farm production and income, while ensuring optimum
use of resources, is major thrust of ICAR through Rabi Agro-Advisories
2021-22. This document is meant to serve the farmers of the countr,
across 28 States and 8 Union Territories, engaged in farming and allied
sectors covering major crops, livestock and fisheries.
ixI congratulate the Agrigultural Extension Division of ICAR and
all the ATARIs for bringing out the publication in regional languages
for the benefit of farmers.

The COVID-19 Pandemic has created unprecedented situation
throughout the world. It has been more than a year and half since
COVID-19 Pandemic threatened the human life by killing millions
across the globe. During this crisis the economies of countries suffered
heavily but agriculture sector showed lot of resilience. Growth of
agriculture sector was not thwarted in India and it continued to set
records of food grains production. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), in
tune with the policy directions and guidelines of Government of India
and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), reached farmers
across the nation using Information and Communication Technology
to issue farm advisories. KVKs also provided necessary input support
by making available seeds and planting materials and agro advisories for
farmers in regional languages.
The Agricultural Technology Application Research Institutes
(ATARIs) throughout India, collaborated with Research Institutes
and State Agricultural Universities, State Agriculture and other Line
Departments to develop Rabi advisories for the benefit of farming
community across the country. The advisories include scientifically
proven best practices related to crops, horticulture, livestock and
fisheries to be followed by the farmers to obtain optimum production
levels with maximum profit during Rabi season 2021-22.
I am very hopeful that these advisories will help farmers and
farmers’ groups in appropriate decision making in maximizing yields
and enhancing farm income. I congratulate the team for bringing out
such important compilation in real time frame for benefit of farming
community of country.

Introduction
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic second wave, Indian Agriculture has
excelled with unprecedented production of food grains attaining the
mark of 308.65 million tons (MT) during 2020-21, with record output
of rice (122.27 MT), wheat (109.52 MT), coarse grains (51.15 MT) and
pulses (25.72 MT) in the food grain basket (4th Advance Estimate, MoA,
2021). Much of this success has been possible owing to Governments’
efforts in reaching millions of farmers, making available the inputs,
proactive actions and framing farmers’ friendly policies.
The second wave of COVID-19 (2021) pandemic posed a serious
problem to the nation halting economic activities in one way or the
other. However, concerted efforts with suitable technological options
could show pathways under such circumstances. Technological options
such as resource conservation and climate resilient technologies,
promotion of hybrids, bio-fortified varieties, focussed approach on
pulses and oilseeds, and crop diversification helped in addressing these
challenges.
Major field crops cultivated in Rabi includes cereals (wheat, barley,
maize); oilseeds (mustard, linseed); pulses (chickpea, lentil, and field
peas); commercial crops like cumin, coriander, fenugreek, fennel etc.
vegetables and fruit crops. Sustaining pulses production can be ensured
by demonstrating production, protection and improved technologies
under different farming situation of Rabi pulses, judicious use of
pesticides for control of insects, pests and diseases. Likewise, targeting
oilseed production, will require adoption of planting techniques like
Broad Bed Furrow (BBF) method, availability of seeds of improved
varieties, participatory seed production, appropriate agronomic
practices and targeting non-traditional areas. Impetus to horizontal
coverage to oil palm in North Eastern states holds good for improving
oil seed production.

The focus should also be on rainfed agro-ecosystem which requires
holistic planning, prioritization of resources and operationalization of
district agricultural contingency plan. If addressed comprehensively,
it can help in sustaining/ enhancing production and productivity of
pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals in the country apart from wheat
during the ensuing Rabi season. Availability of seeds of multiple stress
tolerant varieties, fertilizers, pesticides and supplement irrigation will
add value to the production scenario. For ensuring the set targets, it is
imperative to develop micro-level planning and its implementation at
grass root level.
To cope with shortages of labour and timely availability of inputs at
affordable prices, farmers need to enhance the use of on-farm inputs
especially organic manures, adopt best practices for increasing resource
use efficiency and reduce cost of cultivation. After harvest of paddy,
crop residue management should be given top priority by farmers in
order to protect the environment, soil health and its micro-organisms.
In view of this, ICAR has prepared agro-advisory for farmers for the
early part of Rabi season across the country in all the 28 states and 8
UTs covering major crops, livestock, poultry and fisheries. The agro-
advisory and its regional translations have been organized for respective
states under ATARI Zones (Zones 1 to 11) of the Agricultural Extension
Division of ICAR. The crop, livestock and fisheries advisories mainly
deal with best practices to be adopted by farmers during ensuing Rabi
season. The technical aspects covered in the advisories are related to
seed, soil, water, nutrient and health management in crops, vegetables
&fruits, and livestock enterprises. The zone wise advisory in brief are
given below-
In Zone-I (Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh
and Uttarakhand) major crops cultivated during Rabi are- wheat,
mustard and chickpea. Farmers of these States/UTs are advised to

Zone-I
HImACHAL PRAdesH
Himachal Pradesh is predominantly a hilly state, where majority area
(about 80 %) is rainfed. During Rabi season wheat among cereals,
chickpea & lentil among pulses and sarson among vegetables are
predominant crops. Among vegetables, cole crops, peas, onion,
and garlic are the main crops. Some important advisories to harness
optimum returns are advocated for farmers.
Wheat
HS 542, HPW 360 cultivars of wheat are recommended for low
and mid hill zone of the state under early sown conditions (Up
to 20th October) whereas HPW 155, HPW 349, HPW 249, HPW
236, VL 907, HS 507, HPW 368 are recommended for timely sown
conditions (15 October- 15 November) in these zones. For late
sown conditions (up to December end) VL 892, HPW 373 can be
grown in low and mid hill conditions. HPW 155 and HPW 236 are
recommended cultivars of wheat for high hill zone and Saptdhara
and Him Pratham (DH 114) for high snow-covered areas under
timely sown conditions (1-15th October).
The sowing should be done in lines with spacing of 22 cm with
seed rate of 100 Kg/ha and 150 Kg /ha for timely and late sown
conditions respectively. Before sowing treat the seed with Bavistin
@ 2.5 g/kg of seed. Apply full quantity of SSP (375Kg), MOP (50
Kg) along with 50 per cent of Urea (130 Kg) along with FYM at the
time of sowing while remaining half quantity of Urea should be
given at the time of crown root initiation or occurrence of first rain.
Since, weed causes heavy economic loss to the wheat crop and to
avoid these losses, Vesta @ 400g/ ha or Chlodinafop @ 400g/ha
followed by 2, 4- D @ 1.25 kg/ha after 2-3 days of Clodinofop spray
are recommended for chemical management of weed problems.
15ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs
The spray should be done after the appearance of 2-3 leaf stage in
weeds.
Among diseases yellow rust and Karnal bunt are major problem in
wheat crop which can be managed by the spray of Tilt @ 1ml per
liter of water at the appearance of the symptoms. Termite is major
pest among all pests in this crop and seed treatment with with
chloropyriphos 20 EC @ 4ml/Kg seed along with soil incorporation
of chloropyriphos 20 EC @ 2 L mixing with 25 Kg sand/ha at the
time of sowing is recommended for the management of this pest.
Chickpea
Himachal chana -1, Himachal chana-2, GPF-2, Palam chana-1,
HPG 17 are the recommended cultivars of chickpea. Treat the seeds
with fungicide (Bavistin @2.5gm/Kg of seed) and biofertilizers like
Rhizobium and Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria before sowing. Go
for sowing of crop at proper soil moisture. Mid October is the best
time for it’s sowing, and sowing should be done in lines with 30 cm
line spacing for all cultivars except HPG 17 for which line spacing
of 50 cm is recommended with optimum depth of 10-12.5 cm. The
seed rate for small & medium sized seeded chickpea cultivars like
Himachal chana -1, Himachal chana-2, GPF-2, Palam chana-1 is
40-45 Kg/ha however, for bold seeded cultivars like HPG 17, seed
rate of 80Kg/ha is recommended. Urea 65 Kg, SSP 375Kg and 50Kg
MOP per ha is recommended for the cultivation of chickpea. The
full dose of SSP, MOP and half dose of Urea should be applied at
the time of sowing while reaming half dose of Urea should be given
to crop after 4-5 weeks of sowing.
For the management of pod borer in chickpea, spray the crop with
Carbaryl 50 WP @1250 gm/ha and apply bavistin @1g / L of water
for the management of Acochyta blight.
Lentil
Vipasha and Markandey are the recommended cultivars of Lentil
which can be sown between October end to mid November
16ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs ICAR RABI AgRo-AdvIsoRy foR fARmeRs
with seed rate of 25-30Kg/ha. Urea 22Kg and SSP 250Kg/ha is

Brown sarson and Gobhi Sarson
KBS 3, HPBS 1 and HPN 3, ONK 1, GSC 7 are the recommended
cultivars of Brown and Gobhi Sarson respectively. First fortnight of
October is the best time for the cultivation of these crops.
The seed rate of 6Kg/ha is required, and sowing should be done
with spacing of 30 cm line to line and 10 cm plant to plant. For
brown sarson, apply full does of SSP (250Kg), MOP (65 Kg),
Gipsum (140 Kg) along with 50% of Urea (65Kg) at the time
of sowing while remaing dose of Urea should be applied before
flowering. For Gobhi sarson, apply full does of SSP (375Kg), MOP
(65 Kg) and 50% dose of Urea (125Kg) during sowing time and
rest of Urea should be applied in two splits after 60 days and 80-90
days after sowing.
Two manual weeding are required between 40-70 days of sowing
for the management of weeds. Spray of Pendimethalin (Stomp 30
EC) @ 1.5 Kg /ha as a pre-emergence or Isoproturon @ 1Kg/ha
in 700-800 l of water as post emergence (30-35 days of sowing) is
recommended for the chemical method of weed management.
Aphid is the major pest associated with this crop, which can be
managed by the spray of methyl Demeton 25 EC or dimethoate 30
EC @ 1ml/L of water.

time of transplanting. Remaining part of N should be top dressed
at an interval of one month each while half of potassium is to be
applied along with N during second top dressing. Borex can be
added in the soil for the management of browning in cauliflower
First light irrigation should be given immediately after transplanting
of the seedlings and regular maintenance of optimum moisture is
essential during growth and curd development. The harvesting of
curds is to be done as soon as the curds attain prime maturity and
compactness
Harvesting of broccoli heads at correct time i.e., before the buds
open and when the bud clusters are compact
Damping off of seedlings is major problem in cole crops and for
its control applies Mancozeb 25 g + carbendazim 10 g per 10 litres
of water. Seed treatment with hot water (50 0C) and streptocycline
(1g/ 10 L water) for 30 minutes each is advised for protection
against black rot. In case of attack of aphids and cabbage butterfly,
malathion @ 1ml/ L can be applied. Cypermethin @1mlL can be
applied for protection against cut worms at early stage.

of sowing and second at flower initiation for higher yield. Pre-
emergence application of Alachlor or Pendimethalin @ 3litres /ha
is recommended to check the weeds in the initial growth stages
Irrigations before flowering, during flowering and at pod formation
stages are necessary for quality pods and higher yield.
Picking of pods should be done either early in the morning or
late in the afternoon. Picking should not be done during mid-day
which deteriorates the quality of pea pod due to heat.
Powdery mildew is serious problem in peas which can be controlled
using karathane 0.5 ml or wettable sulphur 2.0 g or hexaconazole
0.5 ml per L of water. For protection against leaf miner and pod
borer lambda cyhalothrin 0.75 ml and malathion 2 ml per L of
