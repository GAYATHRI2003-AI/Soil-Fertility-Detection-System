xii | ContentsPreface
India’s agricultural sector demonstrated robust resilience during the
COVID 19 pandemic, registering positive growth during that period
and the majority of the country’s population remains directly or indirectly
dependent on the sector. Ample evidence suggests that sustainable and
inclusive agricultural growth is best supported by investment in research
and that research managers and policymakers should have a clear and
sustained overview of the sector in order to optimally design and adjust
interventions. With this in mind, during a meeting with distinguished
fellows of the Academy, we recognised the need for an annual report on
the “State of Indian Agriculture”. Duly encouraged by the fellows and
executive members of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences,
we embarked on this journey.
This document intends to highlight the impediments and challenges
within the sector with the aim of finding the most effective path toward
inclusive agricultural growth. We, acknowledge the need for more
in-depth studies and analysis, however we feel that the issues and
recommendations emerging from this publication can foster a better
understanding of the complexities inherent in Indian agriculture. We
feel that this improved understanding can contribute to alignment within
the policy and research framework and milieu. We believe that this will,
in turn, improve efficiency, help ensure equity and sustainability, and
address India’s concerns regarding food and livelihood security at the
national, regional, and household levels.
We thank all the resource persons, reviewers, and fellows of the National
Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) who helped us decide on the
structure and contents of the paper and commenting on a draft version of
it. We received significant input from Dr Seema Bathla, Dr Raka Saxena,
Dr Sendhil R, and Dr P Shinoj. We are grateful to all of them. We would
like to particularly express our sincere thanks to Kriti Sharma, Manpreet
State of Indian Agriculture | xiiiKaur, Sonali Katoch, and Soumya Subhashree Mohapatra for assisting
us in the analysis and drafting of the document. We place on record our
great appreciation for their unflinching support.
We would also like to convey our gratitude to the NAAS for pursuing
and bringing out this publication. We believe that this would help the
ICAR, the Government of India, and other stakeholders enhance the
performance of Indian agriculture and thereby improve the standard of
living of Indian farmers.

xvi | List of AbbreviationsIntroduction
In 2022, India celebrated 75 years of independence from the British Raj.
This marked a watershed moment in the country’s history, the beginning
of its Amrit Kaal or ‘golden era’, the quarter century during which it
resolves to transform itself into a developed nation. In November of 2023,
India concluded its one-year term as president of the G20, a year that
was imbued with the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (One Earth, One
Family, One Future) and during which green, inclusive, and resilient growth
was endorsed as a priority. Tremendous geopolitical turmoil and natural
calamities in recent years have led to supply shocks, slowdown in growth, and
high inflation in several countries. India, during this period, demonstrated
remarkable resilience toward these uncertainties. The country’s growth
story has assumed a structurally more robust trajectory. It has geared up to
turn domestic and international challenges into opportunities, preparing a
blueprint to steer the economy toward a golden era.
India has regained its position as the fastest growing large economy in
the world. In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the gross domestic product (GDP)
grew by 7.2 percent in real terms. A favourable policy environment and
greater focus on capital expenditure together have resulted in a robust
growth of 11.4 percent in the investment-to-GDP ratio. The share of
capital expenditure in GDP (synonymous with capital formation) is high
at 34 percent. Increased investments in the infrastructure, technology,
manufacturing, and agricultural sectors have created the much-needed
momentum for faster and sustainable growth. The increase in capital
expenditure by 37.4 percent over FY2022,envisioned in the Union Budget
FY2023 will further boost investment and ensure long-term economic
growth. These and many more initiatives have laid the groundwork for
faster and more inclusive growth, better institutions, and governance, and
enhanced social welfare.
It goes without saying that the agricultural sector contributes significantly
to India’s socioeconomic growth and development (Pathak et al. 2022).
State of Indian Agriculture | 1Being a principal source of income and livelihood for half the country’s
population, agriculture can help India achieve a developed nation status.
Significant transformations are taking place within the food system; these
range from shifts of traditional farming methods to modern capital-
intensive systems enabled by digital farm services, to the use of artificial
intelligence and drone technology. Efforts have also been made to link
farmers directly with markets in order to help them better assess changing
consumer food preferences. While moving to a higher growth trajectory,
agriculture faces numerous domestic and international challenges; these
include increasingly erratic rainfall, heat waves, the need to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, degradation of water and soil, high
volatility in yield and commodity prices, a surge in imports, global
slowdowns, and increased international conflicts such as that between
Russia and Ukraine and in Palestine.
It is against this backdrop that the National Academy of Agricultural
Sciences (NAAS) offers this report, which intends to delve into the state of
Indian agriculture. Its broad aim is to consider institutional, technological,
and digital interventions in terms of the efficacy with which they augment
farmers’ productivity and income. NAAS has entered its 33rd year as a
leading and successful science academy that is dedicated to the service
of Indian agriculture through scientific and policy-oriented interventions.
Taking stock of the progress that has been made on various fronts in
agriculture will be helpful to the Academy in suggesting appropriate
policies for a faster and more sustainable transformation of agriculture.
The following is the structure of the report. Sections 1 and 2 discuss the
achievements of the agricultural sector in terms of output growth at the
all-India level and across the states, input use patterns, farmers’ income,
and agricultural trade. It also analyses changes in the structure and
composition of agricultural output and the implications of those changes
for the future of Indian agriculture. Sections 3 and 4 highlight farmers’
access to institutional finance, agri-markets and key research; the two
chapters also discuss new developments in the agricultural sector. Section
5 brings forth pertinent issues relating to climate change, and the final
section suggests a way forward for agriculture during the Amrit Kaal.

Indian Agriculture
1.1. Contribution of Agriculture to GDP and
Employment
According to the theory of economic development, as an economy
progresses the contribution of agriculture to GDP and employment
declines and that of the industrial and tertiary (service) sectors increases.
In 1950/1951, 69 percent of India’s total workforce was engaged in
agriculture, contributing 53 percent to the national income. Over the
years, while the share of agriculture has declined in terms of both national
income and employment, the reduction in employment share has not kept
pace with the decline in its share of total income. At the all-India level
in 2022/2023, for instance, the share of agriculture in total employment
was 44.8 percent while its share of GDP stood at 19.2 percent. As of FY
2023, India’s INR 297 trillion (about US $ 3.7 trillion) economy included
19 percent contributed by the agricultural and allied sectors, 31 percent
by industry, and 54 percent by the service sector. Over the long term, the
share of industrial GDP in total GDP has hovered around 25-30 percent,
despite a favourable policy and incentive structure. The current 19 percent
contribution by agriculture to total GDP reflects its sizeable decline in
response to growth in the share contributed by the services sector.
However, it seems that neither the industry nor the service sector has been
able to pull people out of agriculture as 45 percent of India’s 520-million-
person labour force continues to be employed in agriculture. Though
agricultural income is estimated to be INR 46 trillion (about US $0.6
trillion) and is growing, low levels of labour productivity result from the
large numbers of people dependent on it (Figure 1). This mismatch in
income and employment shares may also indicate a neglect of agriculture
in the existing economic development model, which in turn has caused
large disparities in income between the agricultural and non-agricultural
sectors. This suggests an urgent need to recognise the importance of

agriculture by, among other things, improving land and labour productivity
and creating off-farm jobs.
The share of agriculture and its allied sectors in the gross state domestic
product (GSDP) exhibits stark variations across the states (Figure 2). At
the all-India level, agricultural gross value added (GVA) constitutes a

percent share in Puducherry to a 33.3 percent share in Arunachal Pradesh.
A higher share indicates a more significant contribution of agriculture to
state-level economic output and a slower pace of growth in the industrial
and services sectors. Madhya Pradesh follows closely on Arunachal
Pradesh at 31.2 percent, which indicates the prominence of the agricultural
sector in that state’s economy. Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Tripura
also exhibit noteworthy percentage shares at 28.7 percent, 26.1 percent,
and 22.9 percent, respectively. Agriculture maintains a substantial share
of 21.2 percent in both Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, which emphasises the
continued importance of agriculture in their respective economies. Other
states such as Bihar (19.5 percent), Manipur (19.4 percent), and Assam
(18.1 percent) also demonstrate a considerable reliance on agriculture.
1.2. Agricultural Growth and Diversification
Despite global turmoil due to war, natural calamities, and pandemic-
induced disruptions, India has maintained an annual growth momentum of
6 percent for over a decade, and in FY2023 it recorded a robust 7.2 percent
annual rate of growth. The agricultural sector has shown a remarkable
resilience under the prevailing uncertain conditions, as is evidenced by
its 3.3 percent (FY2021) and 3.5 percent (FY2022) annual rate of growth
in real prices. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the past
12-year period ending FY2023 is close to 4 percent (Figure 3). The rate
of growth, however, is not uniform across the states. Figure 3 reveals
the state-wise CAGR of overall GDP and GVA in agriculture over the
decade from 2011/2012 to 2022/2023. Among the eight states of India’s
North-Eastern Region, Mizoram’s progress is significant in terms of GDP
growth (10.1 percent); this is followed closely by Gujarat’s 8.5 percent
growth, and Karnataka’s 7.5 percent growth. In terms of agricultural GVA,
Andhra Pradesh takes the lead with 8.57 percent CAGR, followed by
Mizoram at 8.45 percent and Tripura at 6.02 percent. These figures are
indicative of the economic dynamism and agricultural prowess of these
states. Among the states, Kerala has a negative CAGR in agriculture at
-1.14 percent. A number of other states (Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Rajasthan,
and Uttar Pradesh) have demonstrated consistent growth in both GDP
and agricultural GVA.
Indian agriculture is on a high growth trajectory. One of the factors that
has contributed to higher income growth is diversification toward allied
activities. At the time of independence, the crop sector dominated; in the
subsequent decades, however, especially after the 1980s, acceleration

was seen in the share of livestock. The crop sector’s share in agricultural
GVA decreased from 79.3 percent in Triennium ending (TE) 1952 to 54.8
percent in TE 2022 while the share of livestock has almost doubled from
16 to 30 percent over the same period. The contribution of fisheries to
total value of agricultural output has also increased from 0.6 percent in TE
1952 to 6.6 percent in TE 2022. The share of forestry in total agricultural
GVA remains low (Figure 4).
Within the crop sector, the share of horticulture has increased from 10.8
percent in TE 1952 to 33.5 percent in TE 2022 (Figure 5).
India can boast of achieving food security at the national and household
levels and in recent years it can also be considered to have attained
nutrition security. Due to rising per capita income, growing urbanisation,
and a rapid increase in the integration of the domestic economy with the
world economy, consumers are diversifying toward more nutrient-rich
diets and the agricultural sector is able to meet their demand. Though
the share of the crop sector in total income has been declining, it remains

the principal source of income generation. The crop and livestock sectors
complement each other and thus generate a strong synergy. As evident
from Figure 6, the fisheries subsector is prominent in coastal areas and
forestry is important in hilly regions. Among the states, Andhra Pradesh,
Assam, and Karnataka place significant importance on crops, which
constitute a 38.53, 66.58, and 60.73 percent share in their respective
agricultural GVA totals. Within the crop sector, horticulture emerges as a
significant contributor, as illustrated in Table A2 in the Appendix. In states
such as Sikkim (87.3 percent), Kerala (43.4 percent), Himachal Pradesh

(41.7 percent), and Meghalaya (41.5 percent), horticulture makes a
noteworthy contribution to the agricultural GVA. Relative to other states,
livestock’s share of agricultural GVA is high in Haryana (43.73 percent)
and Punjab (35.26 percent). Fishing and aquaculture activities are notable
in Sikkim and Goa with 87.10 percent and 26.98 percent share in GVA,
respectively. Forestry holds significant importance in the north eastern
states, especially in Mizoram and Assam.
Table 1 presents the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in each
of the agricultural subsectors for the period 2011/2012 to 2022/2023
across states and union territories. Notably, a positive and high rate of
growth in GVA crops can be observed in Madhya Pradesh (5.84 percent),
Karnataka (4.76 percent), and Andhra Pradesh (4.37 percent);livestock
GVA, on the other hand, shows a much higher rate of growth in Madhya
Pradesh (13.48 percent), Assam (12.74 percent), and Tripura (12.99
percent).A few states exhibit a decline in the annual rate of growth
of crop cultivation, including Kerala (-2.36 percent) and Nagaland
(-10.33 percent). Fishing and aquaculture exhibit promising growth in
Meghalaya (15.00 percent), Odisha (11.05 percent), and Chhattisgarh

into the evolving agricultural landscape, highlighting potential areas
that may need attention if higher agricultural growth and sustainable
development is to be achieved.
1.3. T rends in the Production of Major Agricultural
and Allied Products
Over the past five years, both the area and production of major food
crops have shown an increasing trend (Table 2). Between 2021/2022
and 2022/2023, total food grain production increased from about 298
million tons to 330 million metric tons: an increase of about 10 percent.
Rice registered an incremental production about 17 million tons, while
wheat production increased by about 3 million tons during this period.
Total pulse production also witnessed an increase of 3 million tonnes. As
per the first advance estimates for 2023/2024 (Kharif only), total kharif
food grain production is estimated at 148.6 million tons, which is higher
than the average Kharif production over the last three years (2020/2021
to 2022/2023).
Climate change has begun to adversely affect the agricultural sector (Pathak
2023a). During the 2022/2023 Rabi season, a heat wave due to delayed
monsoon and erratic rainfall caused farmers to incur heavy losses, including
a 3.7 percent decline in paddy production (Goswami et al. 2023).
The livestock and fisheries sectors of the economy have been playing
a vital role in improving the socioeconomic conditions of farmers,

especially those operating at a small and marginal scale. In the last
decade, the livestock sector has shown a continuous and stable CAGR
of 7.9 percent. India is the world’s largest milk-producing country, with
a record production of 230.58 mT in 2022/2023. Globally, it is also
the largest producer of buffalo meat, the second-largest producer of
goat meat, and the third-largest producer of eggs and fish (Table 3).

State of Indian Agriculture | 11At 9.7 mT annually, India stands eighth in the world for overall meat
production. Poultry contributes significantly to the overall growth of
the livestock sector, with a sustained increase observed in egg and
poultry meat production. India’s annual fish production has increased
to a record 17.4 mT in 2022/2023 from 14.16 mT in 2019/2020, a
23 percent increase over a three-year period (Figure 8). It presently
holds the distinction of being the world’s second-largest aquaculture
producer and fourth-largest capture fishery producer. During the past
decade, fish production has registered an annual growth rate of about
8 percent. Inland fisheries currently contribute about three-fourths
of the total fish production, with the remainder coming from marine
capture fisheries. Over the past decade, fish production from capture
fisheries (both marine and inland capture) has experienced stagnation;
aquaculture, in the same period, has exhibited a robust performance,
thereby driving most of the sector’s growth. The major cultured species
of inland freshwater fish include the major carps (Catla, Rohu, Mrigal)
as well as other minor and exotic carps, murrels, and catfish. Marine
capture fish production consists mainly of Indian oil sardines, Indian
mackerel, threadfin breams, tuna, penaeid prawns, croakers, sharks, and
skates. Mariculture involves the culture of marine species in enclosed
structures; it is fast emerging as a prospective avenue for future marine
production. Some of the promising mariculture enterprises include cage
culture, seaweed culture, mussel and oyster culture, and ornamental
fish culture (Jena et al. 2023).
Within the crop sector, horticulture contributes significantly to the
economy with a 33 percent share in agricultural GVA. India currently
shows a record production of 351.92 million tonnes of horticultural
products which is produced on 28.12 million hectares (mHa) of land;
this surpasses the area and production of food grains (Figure 7). The
productivity of horticulture crops has increased by 50 percent over the past
two decades; it now stands at 12.49 tons per hectare (t/ha), far exceeding
the productivity of food grains (2.23 t/ha) (Jha et al. 2019). India is the
world’s second-largest producer of fruits and vegetables, with crops such
as spices, plantation crops, and aromatic crops contributing significantly
to the development of the country’s horticultural sector. The Indian
horticultural sector ensures nutritional security and also provides crop
diversification activities, employment opportunities, and improved farm
income; however, increasing population, uncertain supply and demand,
and climate change impose challenges and constraints on horticultural
production systems.

1.4. Sources of Agricultural Growth: Changing Role
of Commodities
The crop sector, despite contributing significantly to the overall agricultural
sector, is declining in importance, moving from about 79 percent in the 1970s
to 60 percent in the 2000s; by 2023, it contributed only 24 percent to the
total. Livestock, in contrast, has almost quintupled and now accounts for more
than half of agricultural growth. Fisheries’ contribution has also increased,
moving from 0.88 percent in the 1950s to 16 percent in the 2011-to-2022
period. Over this period, forestry has exhibited a fluctuating trend (Figure 8).
1.5. Farmers’ Income and Its Main Sources
The Government of India’s paramount objective is the elevation of
farmers’ economic well-being. While Indian agriculture contributed only
19 percent to the country’s GVA in FY 2021/2022 (India, MoA&FW
2023), it remains the primary sector for livelihood and employment, with
over 45.5 percent of the nation’s workforce engaged in agricultural and
allied activities (India, MoSPI 2023). Notably, a higher growth is observed
when real incomes are calculated using the Consumer Price Index for
State of Indian Agriculture | 13Figure 8. Contribution of different subsectors to agricultural growth (percent)

Agricultural Labour (CPIAL) as the deflator. Agricultural households
generate income from various sources including crop cultivation, animal
husbandry, wages and salaries, and non-farm business pursuits. The
real income, adjusted with the GDP deflator, witnessed a growth of 2.47
percent per year between 2002/2003 and 2012/2013, but this slowed
down to 1.5 percent in the 2012/2013 to 2018/2019 period (Figure 9).

14 | Performance of Indian AgricultureWhile overall income of agricultural households has increased (INR
2,115 to INR 10,218) a notable shift has occurred in the composition
of income sources, specifically a decline in the proportion derived
from crop cultivation. The surge in total income of farming households
observed between 2012/2013 and 2018/2019 can be attributed mainly
to substantially increased earnings from wages and animal farming; there
has been, however, a worrisome 2.72 percent annual decline in income
from crop cultivation (Saxena et al. 2023b) (Figure 10).
Figure 10. Growth in farm household income across sources, all India,

Concerted efforts have been made to address this trend; these include
the introduction of enhanced crop varieties, micro-irrigation initiatives,
risk management strategies, and price support programmes specifically
designed to bolster the crop sector. Ensuring sustained growth, however,
requires the effective implementation of these measures coupled with robust
farm linkages. Animal and fish farming are, at the same time, emerging
as promising sectors with significant growth potential. This positive shift
underscores the need to explore and capitalise on opportunities within
these domains, including the diversification of income sources within
agricultural households. Nurturing these sectors through strategic policies
and supportive frameworks can contribute not only to the resilience of
the agricultural economy but also to the overall prosperity of farming
communities.
State of Indian Agriculture | 15A supportive policy environment is crucial for enhancing agricultural
incomes and nutrition security. Its focus should be on the encouragement
of off-farm activities, especially for smallholders. Agricultural households,
irrespective of their landholding size, demonstrate a commendable
level of financial inclusion, with nearly all possessing a bank account;
this reflects the significant strides that have been made in financial
accessibility. Challenges persist in specific domains, however, such as in
crop insurance, where coverage under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima
Yojana (PMFBY) remains dismally low for marginal farmers. This gap
in insurance protection constitutes a considerable level of vulnerability
for this already-vulnerable segment of the farming community. Targeted
interventions to enhance coverage and effectively mitigate risks are thus
necessary.
At the same time, the landscape of registered farm organisations reflects
the stark reality that only a tiny percentage of agricultural households
are members of such organisations. This underscores a potential gap in
collective empowerment and collaborative initiatives and signals the need
for strategies that enhance farmers’ participation in such organisations
so as to foster a sense of community and amplify their collective voice.
The involvement of marginal and small landholders in initiatives such as
the Soil Health Card Scheme and Animal Health Card Scheme is also
notably limited. These programmes are designed to empower farmers by
providing crucial information and resources; they thus need to be more
inclusive and to ensure that smallholders have access to vital tools for
optimising soil and animal health. Bridging these participation gaps is
integral to realising the comprehensive benefits of these schemes across
all tiers of the agricultural community.
The potential industrialisation of rural areas hinges on prioritising labour-
intensive agro-based industries, necessitating a booming rural non-farm
economy to alleviate employment pressure on agriculture. Effective
market intelligence is pivotal for enhancing farmers’ income, urging
the development of domestic marketing linkages and the adoption of
electronic trading platforms such as the Electronic National Agriculture
Market, or e-NAM. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, successful government
interventions, support payments, and enhancements to supply chains
underscored the importance of addressing challenges and ensuring food
security. Post-pandemic, however, global markets imposing stricter food
safety requirements necessitate India’s investment in food quality and
safety infrastructure. The impact of the Russia–Ukraine war on global
commodity prices underscores the uncertainty in global economic prospects
16 | Performance of Indian Agricultureand suggests an urgent need for a robust domestic food production and
trade strategy.
Amidst these challenges, climate change emerges as a critical factor
requiring immediate attention and strategic planning (Pathak 2023a).
Collaborative efforts at local, regional, and national levels are imperative to
develop adaptive strategies that mitigate the impacts of climate change on
Indian agriculture. This necessitates not only robust research collaborations
but also dedicated funding for the development and implementation of
climate-smart technologies, ensuring the sector’s long-term sustainability
(Pathak 2023a).
In embracing these challenges and proactively seizing opportunities, India’s
agricultural sector has the potential to foster resilience, sustainability, and
improved livelihoods for its farming community. A holistic approach,
encompassing strategic policy initiatives, technological advancements, and
global competitiveness can pave the way for a thriving and resilient future
for Indian agriculture.
1.6. Agricultural Trade
Historically, India’s agricultural exports were characterised by spices, tea,
fish and fishery products, cashew nuts, and other distinctive commodities.
Evolving trade dynamics, however, have witnessed the ascendance
of new export leads including basmati rice, meat (particularly buffalo
meat), soybean meal, and groundnut seed. This diversification in export
commodities signifies the adaptability and dynamism of India’s agricultural
trade, including its ability to respond to shifting global demands.
Table 4 compares the composition of agricultural sector exports and
imports in 1992 and 2022. This period saw an increase in the export
share of cereals, livestock, sugar and sugar products. As India moved
toward and beyond self-sufficiency in these crops it began to export greater
quantities, resulting in a significant increase in total agricultural exports.
A decline was registered, on the other hand, in the share of exports of
cotton, coffee, tea, spices, mate and cocoa, products and preparations
of vegetables, and fruits and nuts. As for cotton, both its production and
exports have exhibited fluctuations over the years, however a decline in
cotton yield and the emergence of competitors like Vietnam has reduced
the attractiveness of India’s cotton in the international market (Mukherjee
2023; OEC 2023). Among imports, the share of animal or vegetable fats

and oils in total agricultural imports has increased significantly during the
period. India’s demand for vegetable oil has been on the rise over this
period and domestic production has not been able to satisfy this demand
(Damodaran 2023). A decline has been registered, on the other hand,
in the share of imports of vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereal and cereal
products, cotton, coffee, tea, mate, cocoa and spices. Over this period,
India’s dependence on cereal imports has fallen significantly, as its domestic
production has increased due to the introduction of improved varieties.
Despite rising domestic demand for vegetables, fruits, and nuts,the share
of imports of these commodities has declined, indicating that Indian
farmers are gradually moving from food grains to horticultural crops (The
Economic Times 2023).
In the overall trade landscape, where India has consistently maintained
a negative trade balance since the initiation of planned development in
1950/1951, the agricultural sector’s consistent trade surplus stands out as
a beacon of success. In 2022/2023, India garnered net foreign exchange
18 | Performance of Indian Agricultureearnings of approximately US$20 billion from agricultural trade. The
trajectory of both agricultural exports and imports has been noteworthy,
albeit with distinct growth rates. Between 1992/1993 and 2022/2023,
agricultural exports experienced a commendable annual growth of 9.5
percent, highlighting India’s prowess in catering to international markets.
Agricultural imports, in contrast, surged more rapidly, recording an annual
growth rate in excess of 15 percent. This divergence has contributed to a
substantial reduction in the ratio of agricultural exports to imports, dropping
from 7.4 in 1992/1993 to a modest 1.6 in 2022/2023 (Table 5 and Figure 11).
Figure 11. Trends in the ratio of agricultural exports and imports

and Industry 2023)
Crucially, the country’s capacity to generate exportable surpluses emerges
as a pivotal determinant in shaping its export prospects. This capacity
is subject to fluctuations influenced by macro-economic shifts (mainly
exchange rate) and changes in the production environment (Singh and
Sain 2003). As India continues to navigate the complexities of the global
market, sustaining and enhancing its export competitiveness will be
pivotal for leveraging the full potential of its agricultural prowess on the
international stage.
On the import front, a substantial 72 percent of India’s agricultural imports
in 2023 are in the categories of edible oils, pulses, and fresh and dried
fruits. The escalating import of edible oils stands out as a major concern;
in this, vegetable oils take the lead, constituting a significant 51.9 percent
of the country’s total agricultural imports and making India the world’s
largest importer of vegetable oils. Imports are also expected to double
State of Indian Agriculture | 19Table 5. India’s exports and imports of agricultural commodities
(US$ billion)
to an estimated US$20.8 billion in 2023/2024 from US$10.8 billion in
2017/2018 (GTRI 2023).
This surge in imports poses challenges, but at the same time offers a
compelling opportunity for India to bolster its self-sufficiency in edible
oils. Despite a substantial yield gap of over 50 percent in oilseeds, there
exists immense potential for enhancing domestic production through
strategic technological interventions (Pathak 2023b). Most of these crops
are cultivated under rainfed conditions on marginal lands and research
shows that climate change is likely to have a negative impact on oilseed
production (Birthal et al. 2021). Effec
