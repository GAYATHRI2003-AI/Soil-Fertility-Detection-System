Message
Agriculture and allied sector has emerged as the most resilient sector of Indian economy
post the COVID-19 pandemic, with positive growth rates and increasing production over the
last two years. The sector employs over 50% of the workforce and contributed to around
20% of the country’s Gross Value Added in 2020-21 as per the first revised estimates.
‘Agricultural Statistics at a Glance’ is the flagship publication of the Directorate of Economics
& Statistics and is regarded as the most reliable source of comprehensive and updated
database on variegated aspects of the agriculture sector in India, including economic &
social dimensions, production, trade, minimum support prices, cost of production, food
security, subsidy, agriculture input, insurance, land use statistics etc.
The Directorate of Economics & Statistics has organically revised and upgraded the
publication as per the continuously evolving requirements of the contemporary
world agricultural scenario. This year’s issue has been enriched with the latest
Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households 2019. Moreover, with the
increasing importance of sustainable agriculture as presented by the Goal 2 of SDG,
Zero Hunger: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
sustainable agriculture data on organic farming, CH4 emissions from crop residue
& rice cultivation and water stress have also been incorporated in the publication.
For wider accessibility and utility of users, this publication is also being simultaneously
released on our websites: www.agricoop.nic.in and desagri.gov.in.
I compliment Shri Anil Kumar Sharma, Adviser, Dr. Ramesh Kumar Yadav, Deputy Economic
Adviser, Shri Sanjoy Meitei, Economic Officer and their team members for their efforts in
bringing out this volume in record time.
I am sure that this issue will be found useful by policy makers, academicians, research
organizations, agri-business community and all other stakeholders. I look forward to the
comments for further value addition.

The Directorate of Economics and Statistics is the nodal agency to collate and analyze
data on various aspects of Indian agriculture. Its annual flagship publication ‘Agricultural
Statistics at a Glance’ provides a comprehensive database on important parameters, like area,
production and productivity of various crops across States, land-use statistics, price support
and procurement, international trade, credit and insurance.
The wide-ranging coverage of data and its reliability makes this publication much sought
after and valued. This issue of the publication also includes information on new areas of
concern in agriculture sector; organic farming, water stress, CH4 emissions from burning of
crop residue.
I am grateful to the various contributing Ministries/Departments/Organizations for
providing us with the updated material for the publication. I also record my gratitude to all the
officers of the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, particularly Shri Anil Kumar Sharma,
Adviser and his team for their efforts in bringing out this volume in a new format to align
with international reports related to agriculture. The publication will be of immense use to
policy makers, farmers, researchers, scientists, administrators, trade, industry, statisticians,
economists and the general public.

Notes:
1. For 2001, figures include estimated figures for those of the three sub-divisions viz. Mao Maram, Paomata and Purul
of Senapati district of Manipur as census results of 2001 Census in these three sub- divisions were cancelled due to
technical and administrative reasons.
2. The 1991 Census could not be held owing to disturbed conditions prevailing in Jammu & Kashmir. Hence the population
figures for 1991 of Jammu & Kashmir have been worked out by ‘interpolation’. The data on workers in Col. 5-7 exclude
J&K.
3. The 1981 census could not be held in Assam. The figures for 1981 for Assam have been worked out by interpolation.
The data on workers in Col. 5-7 exclude Assam.
4. Figures within parentheses in Col.-4 are percentages to the Total Population.
5. Figures within parentheses in Col.-6 and 7 are percentages to Col.-8.
6. Figures within parentheses in Col.-8 is percentage share of Agricultural Workers in Total Workers.Economic & Social Dimensions of Agriculture | 3
