Abstract:Duringthepreviousthreedecades,organicproducehasattractedtheattentionofagrowing
health-conscious population across the globe. Both international and domestic communities are
becomingawareofissueslikeagrochemicalresidues,producequality,andfoodsafety. Worldwide,
over 37.5 million ha of land (0.87% of total agricultural land) is being managed organically
by1.9million producers in 164 countries. In addition, there is another 31 million ha certified for
wild harvest collection. Global sales of organic products have reached U.S. $75 billion, with the
U.S.andEuropeasthelargestconsumers. TheconceptoforganicfarmingisnotnewtotheIndian

where consumers are increasingly aware of what they eat and consume, quality and safety have
becomekeyissuesanduniquesellingpropositions.

has put forth a question regarding the sustainability of agriculture/horticulture in the long term,
callingattentiontosustainableproductionpracticeswhichaddresssocial,ecological,andeconomic
issuestogether. Recognizingtheimpactoftheexcessiveuseofchemicalfertilizersonsoilhealthand
pesticides on human health, there has been an effort to develop integrated management systems.
Organicfarmingaddressessoil,human,andenvironmentalhealth,andiseco-friendly,andthusmay
beoneoftheoptionsforsustainability[3].
2. OrganicFarming
Inaverysimplisticform, organicfarmingisthepracticeofgrowingcropswithouttheuseof
syntheticpesticides,herbicides,andfertilizers. Rather,itreliesmainlyoncroprotation,useofcrop
residues by soil incorporation of cover crops, and biomass recycling such as composting, animal
integration,andbiofertilizerstomaintainsoilhealthwithoutdisturbingtheecologicalenvironment
in order to obtain sustainably high yields. The Codex Alimentarius commission—a joint body of
FAO/WHO—definedorganicagricultureasauniqueproductionmanagementsystemwhichpromotes
and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological
activity,accomplishedbytheuseofon-farmagronomic,biological,andmechanicalmethodsandthe
exclusion of all synthetic off-farm inputs [4]. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture
Movements(IFOAM)hasformulatedfourbroadprinciplesoforganicfarming,whicharethebasic

3. IndianInitiatives
HistoricallyinIndia,agricultureutilizedorganic-likepractices. Evenpresently,muchoftheforest
produceofeconomicimportance,suchasherbs,medicinalplants,etc.,isinthiscategory. Indiahas
brought4.72millionhaunderorganiccertificationprocesses,including0.6millionhaofcultivated
agricultural land and 4.12 million ha for wild harvest collection in forests, as of March 2014 [5].
Sikkim has become India’s first fully organic state by implementing organic practices on
approximately75,000haofagriculturalland[6]. Therehasbeenaconsistentincreaseinthenumber
of certified farmers in the country every year. Organic farmers’ associations have taken the lead
in adopting and spreading technology. Institutional support for organic production was created
bythelaunchoftheNationalProgrammeforOrganicProduction(NPOP)bytheAgricultureand
ProcessedFoodExportDevelopmentAuthority(APEDA),MinistryofCommerce. TheNPOPsupports
promotional initiatives, accreditation of inspection and certification agencies, and offers support
to agri-business enterprises to facilitate export. APEDA has been interacting with the European
Union(EU),theUnitedStatesDepartmentofAgriculture(USDA),Japan,andIFOAMforrecognition
of equivalence of the Indian quality assurance system. India was recognized for the purpose of
equivalencesinceJune2006foranunspecifiedduration,asreportedintheAnnexIIIofRegulationHorticulturae2016,2,17 3of6
(EC)1235/2008. However,theEuropeanUnion’sorganicproductionrulesarenotformallyrecognized
asequivalentbyIndia.
In2004,India’sMinistryofAgriculturelaunchedanationwideinitiative—theNationalProjecton
OrganicFarming(NPOF)—withtheobjectiveofpromotingorganicfarminginIndiabyfacilitating
accesstoorganicinputs,streamliningproduction,facilitatingcertification,anddevelopingdomestic
marketsfororganiccommodities. In2004–2005,anationalCentreforOrganicFarmingwasestablished
under the Ministry of Agriculture at Ghaziabad to provide institutional support and to facilitate
movingfarmersintoorganiccropproductionbyprovidingsuitablelogistics.TheNationalHorticulture
MissionlaunchedbyIndia’sDepartmentofAgricultureandCooperationin2005offersassistance
fortransitioningtoorganicfarmingofhorticulturalcrops. Asaresultoftheseinterventions,organic
agriculturehasseenunexpectedlyhighgrowth. Bythecombinedeffortoffarmers,thegovernment,
NGOs,andmarketforces,theIndianorganicmovementhasreachedastagewhereitcanswiftlymove
tooccupyadesiredspaceinIndianagriculture. Today,IndiaisalongsidetheEU,theU.S.,Japan,Brazil,
Argentina,andSwitzerland,whichhaveadoptedorganicstandardsandputinplaceaninspection
andcertificationmechanism[7].
4. CurrentStatus
India has the largest number of organic producers in the world most with small holdings.
During2013–2014,Indiaexported135productsvaluedat$403million. Majordestinationsfororganic
productsfromIndiaweretheU.S.,theEU,Canada,Switzerland,Australia,NewZealand,South-East
Asian countries, West Asia, and South Africa. Soybean comprised 70% of the commodities, and
productsexportedfollowedbycerealsandmilletsotherthanbasmatirice(4%),sugar(3%),tea(2%),
pulsesandlentils(1%),dryfruits(1%),andspices(1%)[8].
OrganicfarmingisgrowingrapidlyamongIndianfarmersandentrepreneurs,especiallyinlow
productivityareas,rain-fedzones,hillyareas,andthenortheasternstates,wherefertilizerconsumption
islessthan25kg/ha/year. NinestatesinIndiahavepromotedpoliciesandprogramsonorganic
farming. Uttrakhandhasmadeorganicathrustforimprovingitsmountainagriculturefarmeconomy
and livelihood. Mizoram and Sikkim declared their intentions to move to total organic farming.
Karnatakahasformulatedorganicpolicies,andMaharashtra,TamilNadu,andKeralahavesupported
public–privatepartnershipsforthepromotionoforganicfarming.
5. QualityRegulation
Organicagriculturesystemsandproductsarerequiredtobecertifiedbyaccreditedagenciesto
indicatethattheyhavebeenproduced,stored,processed,handled,andmarketedinaccordancewith
technical specifications. The organic label is a production process claim, as opposed to a product
qualityclaim. Indianowhas26accreditedcertificationagenciestofacilitatethecertificationofgrowers.
InIndia,theTeaBoard,CoffeeBoard,SpicesBoard,andCoconutDevelopmentBoardhavedeveloped
guidelinesforproductionandcertification,andhaveencouragedtheproductionandexportoforganic
produceandproducts. Recognizingtheneedfororganicfarming, theMinistryofAgriculturehas
also taken the major initiative that production and certification for domestic markets shall be the
responsibilityoftheMinistryofAgriculture.
Therearenowover150countriesintheworldexportingcertifiedorganicproducts. Organictrade
is expanding at the rate of 15%–20% per year. Over 500 public and private certification bodies
nowoperateintheglobalorganicmarketplace[9]. Themanygovernmentalandprivatestandards

6. KeyOpportunitiesinIndia
Indiaisoneoftheleadingfruitproducersintheworld,producingabout10%oftheworld’sfruit
production [10]. Most of the produce is consumed fresh and domestically. The main destinations
aretheMiddleEast,Europe,andSoutheastAsia. Indiaisthelargestmangoproducerintheworld;
however,anegligibleamountoffresh(42,998.31MT)andprocessedmangoesareexportedduetohuge
domesticdemand[11]. TheUK,Netherlands,andGermanyhaveahighdemandfororganicmangoes,
whichcouldbeexploitedbyIndia.Indianorganicbananaexportsarenegligibleinrelationtotheworld
trade. Indianeedstofollowatwo-prongedstrategyforincreasingorganicbananaexports. First,it
should target the processed organic banana market (pulp, purees, and concentrates), and second,
itshouldfocusonthegeographicallycloserJapanesemarketandtheEU[9].

India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world after China, followed by
the Middle East, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, the EU, and Australia [12].

theirmarketsinEurope,oneoftheleadingteaconsumingregions. Organiccoffeeismainlyconsumed
bythedevelopedcountries;namely,theU.S.,Germany,France,Italy,Japan,andtheEU.Indiaaccounts
for 1% of the estimated world organic coffee market, so there is exceptional potential to increase
its exports in the near future. India currently accounts for over 12% (in terms of quantity) of the
worldspicemarket. ThemainconsumersoforganicspicesareGermany,theUK,France,Japan,and
theU.S.However,organicspicesinIndiarepresentaverynegligiblepartoftotalspiceproduction.

7. IndianOrganicFoodMarket
India’sorganicindustryisjustbeginningtogainattentioninthemarketplaceinurbancenters,
primarily with small shops and groceries. However, the retail scene in India is beginning to see
dramaticchangeswiththerecentdevelopmentofhyper-marketsinmostmetropolitancities. Today,
everysupermarkethasanorganicfoodsection,andeverylargecityinIndiahasnumerousorganic
food stores and restaurants. This is a huge change considering that the first organic food store in
Mumbaiwasstartedin1997. ThepatternoforganicfoodconsumptioninIndiaismuchdifferentthan
indevelopedcountries. InIndia,consumerspreferorganicfruits,vegetables,spices,strawberry,tea,
organicmarmalade,organichoney,organicbutter,andvariousorganicflours. However,thereare
manyconsumerswhoareunawareofthedifferencebetweennaturalandorganicfood. Manypeople
purchaseproductslabeledas“Natural”thinkingthattheyareorganic. However,consumersarenotHorticulturae2016,2,17 5of6
aware of the certification system, since certification is not compulsory for domestic retail in India.
Theoverallgrowthinthemarketoforganicproductswasestimatedat14%forspices,15%forbanana,
14%fortea,11%forrice,8%forfruit,8%forherbalextracts,8%forcotton,and4.5%forturmeric[13].
Organicproductionisnotlimitedtothefoodssector,butalsoappliestosignificantamountsoforganic

8. Conclusions
India’sorganicexportmarketswouldgrowwiththesupportoftheindustry,thegovernment,and
NGOscomingtogethertoworkwithfarmers. Thefutureformarketsfororganicfoodsisdefinitely
bright, as it is growing rapidly in the EU, in the U.S. and Canada, and in Japan and Australia, as
