The report discusses the climate conditions in the Indian region during the
year 2024. Notably, global temperatures soared to exceptionally high
levels during this period. The annual mean land surface air temperature
averaged over India during 2024 was +0.65°C above the long-term
average (1991-2020 period). This marked the warmest year since
nationwide records began in 1901, surpassing the previous highest
temperature observed in 2016, which had an anomaly of +0.54°C. The all-
India mean temperature was above normal, with anomalies of +0.37°C,
+0.56°C, +0.71°C, and +0.83°C during the winter (January to February),
pre-monsoon (March to May), southwest monsoon (June to September),
and post-monsoon (October to December) seasons, respectively.
Heatwave conditions were observed over most parts of the east coast in
April, most parts of northwest India in May, and most parts of Northern
and central India in the month of June.
The 2024 annual rainfall over the country as a whole was 104% of its
17 Abstract
Long Period Average (LPA) value for the period 1971-2020. The monsoon
season rainfall over the country as a whole was 108% of its LPA. The
seasonal rainfall during the Northeast monsoon season (October –
December) over the NE Monsoon core region of the south peninsula was
122% of its LPA. In 2024, four cyclonic storms formed over the North
Indian Ocean. Of these, two were severe cyclonic storms (REMAL and
DANA), and two were cyclonic storms. Three of these cyclones formed
over the Arabian Sea (as remnants from the Bay of Bengal). Among these
systems, REMAL formed during the pre-monsoon season (May 24-28),
ASNA during the monsoon season (August 25 to September 2), and
DANA (October 22-26) and FENGEL (November 25 to December 2)
formed during the post-monsoon season. In addition to these cyclones,
extreme weather events such as extremely heavy rainfall, floods,
landslides, lightning, thunderstorms, droughts, and others were also
experienced in various parts of the country.

+0.71°C, and +0.83°C during the winter (January to February), pre-monsoon (March to May), southwest
monsoon (June to September), and post-monsoon (October to December) seasons, respectively.
Heatwave conditions were observed over most parts of the east coast in April, most parts of
northwest India in May, and most parts of Northern and central India in June.
The 2024 annual rainfall over the country as a whole was 104% of its Long Period Average
(LPA) value for the period 1971-2020. The monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole was
108% of its LPA. The seasonal rainfall during the Northeast monsoon season (October – December)
over the NE Monsoon core region of the south peninsula was 122% of its LPA.
In 2024, four cyclonic storms formed over the North Indian Ocean. Of these, two were severe
cyclonic storms (REMAL and DANA), and two were cyclonic storms (ASNA and FENGAL). Three of
these cyclones—REMAL, DANA, and FENGAL—formed over the Bay of Bengal, while ASNA formed
over the Arabian Sea (as remnants from the Bay of Bengal).
Various parts of the country also experienced extreme weather events like extremely heavy rainfall,
floods, landslides, lightning, thunderstorms, heat waves, cold waves, hailstorms, etc., which caused
about 2400 deaths, out of which more than 1280 were due to lightning and thunderstorm.

temperature, and (c) Minimum temperature. (Based on 1991-2020 Average)
The country's annual mean land surface air temperature during the year 2024 was +0.65°C above
the 1991-2020 average. Thus, making the year 2024 the warmest year on record since 1901 (Fig. 2).
The five warmest years on record, in descending order, are 2024 (+0.65°C), 2016 (+0.54°C),
2009(+0.40°C), 2010 (+0.39°C) and 2017 (+0.38°C). 10 out of the 15 warmest years were observed in the
recent fifteen years (2010-2024). The past decade (2015-2024) was also the warmest decade on record,
with the decadal averaged annual mean temperature anomaly (Actual-LPA) of 0.31°C. The country
averaged annual mean temperature during 1901-2024 showed a significant increasing trend of 0.68°C
/100 years (Fig.2). During the same period, significant increasing trends were observed in maximum
(0.89°C /100 years) and minimum (0.46°C /100 years) temperatures.
The all India averaged seasonal mean temperature was above normal for all the seasons during
the year 2024: the winter season (January - February, with an anomaly of +0.37°C), pre-monsoon
season (March-May, with an anomaly of +0.56°C), southwest monsoon (June - September, +0.71°C)
season and post-monsoon season (October- December, with an anomaly of +0.83°C).
The monthly mean temperatures averaged over the country during 2024 were above normal for
all the months of the year except March (close to normal with an anomaly of +0.22°C). The mean
monthly temperatures averaged over the country during October was the highest recorded (with an
anomaly of +1.23°C) and the 2nd highest during July & September (with anomalies of +0.70°C and
+0.76°C respectively) since 1901. In addition, the mean temperature during November was the 3rd
highest (with an anomaly of +0.84°C), and May & August were the 4th highest (with anomalies of
+0.69°C and +0.45°C respectively) since 1901.
In 2024, the monthly maximum temperature averaged over the country was the 2nd highest (with
an anomaly of +0.62°C) since 1901 for November.
In 2024, the monthly minimum temperatures averaged over the country were the highest during
July, August, September, and October with anomalies of +0.89°C, +0.59°C, +0.99°C and +1.78°C

23C) Standardized Precipitation Index
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for measuring drought and is based
on precipitation. This index is negative for dry and positive for wet conditions. The index becomes more
negative or positive as the dry or wet conditions become more severe. Fig.18 gives the district-wise SPI
values for the year 2024.
Cumulative SPI values of the past twelve months indicate extremely wet / severely wet
conditions over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Sub Himalayan

24D) TROPICAL STORMS / DEPRESSIONS IN THE INDIAN SEAS:
In 2024, four cyclonic storms formed over the North Indian Ocean. Of these, two were severe
cyclonic storms (REMAL and DANA) and two were cyclonic storms (ASNA and FENGAL). Three of
these cyclones—REMAL, DANA, and FENGAL—formed over the Bay of Bengal, while ASNA formed
over the Arabian Sea (as remnants from the Bay of Bengal).
Among these systems, REMAL formed during the pre-monsoon season (May 24-28), ASNA
during the monsoon season (August 25 to September 2), and DANA (October 22-26) and FENGAL
(November 25 to December 2) formed during the post-monsoon season. In addition to these cyclones,
extreme weather events such as extremely heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, lightning, thunderstorms,
droughts, and others were also experienced in various parts of the country.
During the winter season, no intense low-pressure system formed.
During pre-monsoon season, Severe Cyclonic Storm “REMAL” formed over the Bay of Bengal
during the period 24 - 28 May, and a low-pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea.
During the monsoon season, thirteen low-pressure systems (one cyclonic storm, three Deep
Depressions, two Depressions, one well-marked low-pressure area, and six low-pressure areas) were
formed. The frequency and place of origin of these low-pressure systems formed over the Indian region
during the monsoon season are shown in the table below.
