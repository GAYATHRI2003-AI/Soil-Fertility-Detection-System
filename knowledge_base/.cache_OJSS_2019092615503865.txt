1. Introduction
Soil health is the basic requirement to produce quality food for consumption.

Different physical, chemical and biological properties are considered either
quantitatively or qualitatively to determine soil health. Parameters that are easy
to measure and sensitive to management options indicate good soil quality indi-
cators. Generally, soil pH, surface hardness, aggregate stability, soil organic car-
bon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), crop residues, earthworms, soil
depth, slope, etc. can be utilized for soil quality index (SQI) determination. It is
typically achieved using a modeling framework, which can broadly be divided
into function- and process-based analyses. Many approaches like Cornell’s ap-
proach [1], Wisconsin Soil Health Score Card, Illinois Soil Quality Initiative,
Radar Diagram, Ohio Soil Health Card [2], Agroeco-system Performance As-
sessment Tool, Soil Conditioning Index, Soil Management Assessment Frame-
work [3], etc. are found in the literature having different complexities and in-
adequacies. As the steps of mechanistic processes are seldom calibrated and de-
scribed, the proposal for direct estimates of soil quality from indicator data
through process-based approach, without the use of empirical weighting factors
or functional equations, is often very difficult to achieve. Some of the important
approaches for function-based model are productivity index [4], SQI [5] and
scoring functions [6].
Most research on quality assessment are based on surface soil dynamic prop-
erties data [7] [8] [9] [10] that do not reflect sub-surface characters for proper
crop production and managements to be adopted [11]. A long list of items has
been selected to evaluate SQI, but not considered soil depth and slope in many
cases. Slope plays an important role in degrading soil quality and thus special
management is needed to recuperate it. Vasu et al. [12] reported a good rela-
tionship of SQI with soil function when subsurface properties were included
with surface dynamic ones; but Mukherjee and Lal [13] found no variation with
sub-surface properties. However, they have not considered whole country, a gi-
gantic task for a nation to be accomplished.
Soil amendment in association with crop production is an inevitable part of
agriculture, and thus changes in its nature take place over time. To utilize soil
potential sustainably, the determination of SQI, though not simple, is essential.
Old methods for SQI assessment were mostly based on qualitative and quantita-
tive parameters [14] [15] [16], but it requires quantitative index for agricultural
land suitability assessment [12] [17] [18]. Therefore, SQI has a greater signific-
ance for sustainable use of soil in crop production. One can use simple additive,
weighted additive and statistically modeled derived SQI, because no standard
method yet is established. Mukherjee and Lal [13] reported suitability of statis-
tical based principal component analysis (PCA) for SQI determination. We hy-
pothesize that a combination of multiplicative model and logic based scoring for
SQI might be beneficial for soil health quality scoring.
Bangladesh, a deltaic country, is heavily pressurizing its soil resources for
more production in one hand and on the other, climate change impacts are
adding additional burden to natural resources through salinization because of
sea level rise, reduced upstream flow, increasing acidity through diminishing ba-

sic cations, etc. In a small country, like Bangladesh, there are many soils with
plenty of potentials and limitations; but unfortunately no SQI is available for its
proper management and sustainable crop production to feed about 160 million
peoples. This scenario is also true for many developing countries of the world.
Therefore, we have taken an initiative to develop SQI for Bangladesh, which can
also be utilized for other similar environments of the globe.
2. Material and Methods
In the present investigation, the attributes considered for soil health scoring are
texture, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil pH, soil available water, cation exchange
capacity (CEC), bulk density (BD) for clayey and non-clayey soils, porosity, sa-
turated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil salinity, soil aggregate stability
(WDCS), slope, and soil depth. In selecting data from available sources, expert
judgement, crop performance, soil complexity and functions were considered
[10] [12]. Data were collected from Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council,
Soil Resource Development Institute and published literatures during 2010-2018
considering 64 districts of Bangladesh. Attribute-wise ratings over different loca-
tions of Bangladesh were made by using interpolation technique (using
MS-Excel Macros and IDRISI3.2). Delineation maps of attribute-wise rating
were prepared by using IDRISI3.2. Development of soil health rating map was
accomplished by integrating multiplicative, model, and logic and finally follow-
ing geometric means approach. Direct measured data on soil pH, soil texture,
CEC (cmol·kg–1), SOC (%), soil depth (cm), slope (%), soil salinity (dS·m–1) and
c
drainage were used. Others were computed following standard protocols.
Field capacity (FC), wilting point and Ks was derived by using decision sup-
port system for agro-technology transfer (DSSAT) inbuilt transfer functions us-
ing sand, silt, clay and SOC. Adhikary et al. [19] also used pedo-transfer func-
tions for predicting hydraulic properties of Indian soils. Computed FC and
DSSAT inbuilt FC showed very close relationship (y = 0.922x + 0.029; R2 =
0.922). The permanent wilting point (PWP) was estimated as following equation
y=−5E−05x2+0.007x+0.019; R2 =0.898 (1)
where, y is the PWP (vol. fraction) and x is the % clay
The inter-relationships of BD, FC, wilting point, available water, total porosi-
ty, macro-porosity, and Ks were established with percent clay contents. Soil
available water was considered as the difference between FC and PWP. With re-
gard to computed some of the soil physical constants, pedo-transfer functions as
developed by Kalra et al. [20] for Indian soils were also evaluated because of its
similarities with Bangladesh.
2.1. Water Dispersible Soil Aggregate Stability Index
From our long term trial at Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, Gazipur, we
have found 7.02 - 7.66 mean weight diameter (mm) aggregate size from silty clay
soil (Haque et al., [21]), which was close to the findings (7.41 - 11.28) of Sung,
DOI: 10.4236/ojss.2019.99011 191 Open Journal of Soil ScienceJ. C. Biswas et al.
[22] having similar clay fractions. In our case, soil samples were very limited, so
we have determined WDCS by the following equation adopted from Sung [22]
as follows:
y=9.306508+1.157381Silt(%)+0.150741Sand(%); R2 =0.4413 (2)
where, y is the WDCS index.
2.2. Bulk Density (Mg·m–3)
It was determined through pedo-transfer function as
y=−0.09ln(x)+1.605, R2 =0.502 (3)
where, y is the bulk density in Mg·m–3, x is the % clay content.
2.3. Soil Available Water Content (Volume Fraction)
It was determined by subtracting PWP from FC.
2.4. Total Porosity (Volume Fraction)
It was determined as per following equation
y=0.403x0.066, R2 =0.526 (4)
where, y is the total porosity and x is the % clay content.
2.5. Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity (cm·hr–1)
It was estimated as per following equation
y=−9E−06x3+0.001x2−0.091x+1.845, R2 =0.784 (5)
where, y is the saturated Ks in cm·hr−1 and x is the % clay content.
2.6. Field Capacity (Volume Fraction)
The FC was determined through DSSAT inbuilt pedo-transfer function, to
compare it with derived FC, as shown in following equation. It showed very
good estimation with DSSAT values (R2 = 0.922), which have been used in the
present investigation.
FC=0.0818+0.07225∗SOC(%)+0.00525∗Clay(%)+0.00161∗Silt(%)

2.7. Scoring Criteria Used
Scoring on different attributes was done on 0 - 100 scale. We have allocated the
score based on sensitivity to growth and development of plants. The criteria
were fixed based on logic and personal experiences. The most dominant factors
such as soil salinity, pH, and drainage play an important role in deciding soil
health and crop growth and development. The scoring values were 25, 40, 60,
100, 90, 85, 80, 80, 75, 70, 60 and 60 for sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt
loam, silt, sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay and clay
respectively. Scores assigned for well drained, medium well drained to well
drained but surface imperfect drainage, imperfectly drained, poorly drain early,

poorly drain late and very poorly drain were 100, 75, 50, 30, 20 and 5, respec-
tively. The scoring criteria for other attributes are shown in Table 1 and Figures

2.8. Relationship of SQI with Crop Production
2.8.1. Production Function (Additive)
On the basis of 13 attributes, chosen for defining the soil health, additive func-
tion was generated to compute wheat yield (five years average over the districts,
taken from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics). The function was generated
through multiple regression approach as shown below in which the regression
coefficients indicated the sensitivity of each attribute.
Y =∑13 a ∗Att +A (7)
i=1 i i
where, Y is the computed yield (t·ha–1)
a is the regression coefficient (for ith attribute)

Att is the attribute (ith)

i = 1 - 13 (attribute number) and A is the constant
2.8.2. Production Function (Multiplicative)
Crop growth and development are influenced by different stress factors in di-
verse ways having variable severity potential. One attribute might be very in-
fluential than the others. So, additive function might not be effective in predict-
ing the productivity of a test crop. Thereby, it was thought to deal the in-
ter-attributes stresses in a multiplicative procedure, as given in the equation be-
low:
Y = A∗π13 (Att )λi (8)

where, Y is the relative yield (ratio of actual yield to attainable yield)

Weighted power coefficients (λ) were computed based on Equation (7) by

The values of λ can indicate the relative sensitivity of each attributes towards

computation of the productivity.
2.9. Soil Quality Index Determination
Soil health rating indices were computed through geometric mean calculation in
six approaches (discussed later) and compared with PCA using SPSS (version
16). Weightage factor for each principal component (PC) was calculated based
on total percentage of variance divided by percentage of cumulative variance [9].
Minimum soil attributes were selected at per Vasu et al. [12], by considering
moderate (0.5 - 0.75) and strong (>0.75) varimax factor loads. However, soil pa-
rameters having strong factor loads were considered for establishing relationship
with attained SQI score and grain yields of wheat.
All 13 attributes were considered for geometric means calculation in approach
one, as the stress of one attribute influences the others. Since the living system
productivity is primarily driven by the most stressed biotic/abiotic factor, the
attribute with the lowest rating was considered in approach two. In other ap-
proaches, the soil health rating indices were developed by evaluating the geome-
tric means of the lowest rated two, three, four and five attributes for each dis-
trict.
Geometric mean (GM) score was calculated as follows:
GM=([Parameter1]∗[Parameter2]∗[Parameter3]∗∗[Parameter13])113
3. Results
In terms of texture, the SQI of 50 - 70 group was clay, silty clay and sandy clay
dominated soils (35%). Sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam and silty clay
loam represented about 30% areas of the country (Figure 2(a)). The top scoring
group (SQI > 90) was loam in texture that covered about 8.6% areas. About 21%
soils were with good aggregate stability, but 24% soils belong to very low aggre-
gate stability group (Figure 2(b)) because of higher silt and sand contents. Al-
most 21% soils showed less than 50% porosity (Figure 2(c)). In terms of BD,
nearly 38% soils belong to 1.5 - 1.6 Mg·m–3 category (Figure 2(d)) and the rest
in several other groups. In most soils (about 50%), available water was high
(Figure 2(e)) and about 15% had the least water availability. About 41% soils
showed Ks of 0.5 - 1.5 cm·hr–1 and the others were 0.1 - 0.4 cm·hr–1 (Figure
2(f)). The CEC score was <20 in less than one percent area of Bangladesh; 20 -
50, 50 - 70 and >70 scores in about 40%, 36% and 22% soils, respectively (Figure
2(g)). Soil depths in most cases (~71%) were high and only 10% of them belong
to shallow depth category (Figure 2(h)). Fifty percent soils scored > 85 for SOC
contents that had more than 1.2% organic C (Figure 3(a)), others were poor in
SOC. Almost 40% soils belong to good soil pH ranges (Figure 3(b)), although
DOI: 10.4236/ojss.2019.99011 195 Open Journal of Soil ScienceJ. C. Biswas et al.
critical soil pH in the lower range covers about 26% areas in Bangladesh. There
are very strongly acid soils in about 15% areas, pH 4.0 - 5.5 in 22.3%, pH 7.5 -
8.25 in 34.2% and >8.25 pH in 28.1% areas of Bangladesh.

More than 80% soils are flat in Bangladesh (Figure 3(c)) and only 6% belong
to steep slope areas. Well drained soils comprised only about 10% in Bangladesh
that scored >70% (Figure 3(d)). Most soils suffer from drainage problems de-
pending on crop growing season and rainfall patterns. Major soils (83%) are
non-saline (0 - 1.0 dS·m–1 in Bangladesh (Figure 3(e)) and about 4.8% face sa-
linity problem of >6.0 dS·m–1.
Considering all tested soil quality parameters, about 64.6% soils scored more
than 60% and 23.2% in the category of 50 - 60 and about 12.3% in the least
scoring groups (Figure 3(f)). When the relationship of SQI was done with
productivity, the predictability was relatively lower. Considering all the test
attributes, soil health in relation to crop’s response was not satisfactory. The least
scoring range was increasing with time due to enhanced industrial pollution, sa-

linity rise and urbanization (data not reported). The best soil group (scored >
70) covers only about 15% areas in the country having potential for growing
high value crops.
The attained scores were evaluated against average wheat grain yields of
2011-2015, considering all soil tested attributes, two most minimum scoring
attributes and one most minimum scoring attribute (Figures 4(a)-(c)) and it
could be concluded that predictability increased when we take the attribute that
highly impair crop growth and development.
Grain yields of wheat as estimated from multiple regressions considering all
tested attributes (Equation # 10) can explain about 44% of its yield variability.
Computed and observed grain yields of wheat showed good relationship with
soil health score (Figure 5(a)).

For comparative evaluation of six soil health rating indices, the values derived
in each district was evaluated against wheat yields (average over five years), and
the correlation matrix was drawn. From the correlation matrix, it could be con-
cluded that if we take one or two attributes with most limiting factor for crop
growth and development, the coefficient of predictability of wheat yields im-
proves (Table 2).
We also employed PCA to find out minimum soil attributes that effectively
influence soil health scoring index. It was found that about 45.5% of variations
in soil health rating could be explained if PC1 and PC2 are considered (Table 3).
Considering strongly loaded factors, the SOC (0.78), WDCS (0.868), Ks (0.926),
BD (0.754), drainage (0.823) and slope (−0.904) were the important attributes
for soil health determination of which BD and WDCS represented PC1, slope
and drainage PC2 and Ks and SOC represented PC3. However, the PCA based
selected six attributes were able to explain about 36% yield variability of wheat
crop in Bangladesh (y = −0.4754 + 0.0024*BD − 0.0103*SOC − 0.0061*Ks +
0.0304*Slope + 0.0061*WDCS + 0.0208*Drainage; R2 = 0.3634**; P ).

4. Discussion
We have chosen 13 attributes for SQI development of which soil salinity and
drainage play a pivotal role for arable crop production in Bangladesh; but Ve-
lasquez et al. [23] used 50 soils properties, the highest number of soil attributes,
to develop a general SQI that might not be suitable for many researchers in de-
veloping countries. However, reports on SQI with fewer attributes are also
available. The soil management frame work based on SQI considered 13 para-
meters from physical, chemical and biological factors [24], but they ignored soil
depth, which is important for many regions of the world. Laishram et al. [25]
reported 12 soil indicators for soil health assessment. They have included sus-
pected pollutants and soil respiration– important points, but not easily available
in many developing countries. Though works on soil pollutions are on-going
sporadically, adequate data on soil biology are not available in this part of the
world. So, we were unable to include those factors. We have considered SOC
that actually dictates microbial activities [26] [27] and acts as a source of plant
nutrients [28] [29]. Loganathan and Narendiran [29] also reported that soil or-
ganic matter and aggregate stability are important indicators for soil quality as-
sessment. Different statistical tools, such as multiple correlations, PCA, star
plots, factor and cluster analyses are performed for SQI determination [30] [31].
We have utilized additive and multiplicative production function through re-
gression analysis to deal with inter-attributes interactions and six approaches for
geometric mean score determination and finally correlated with wheat crop
yields to reveal a new methodology of soil health quality determination.
Soils of Bangladesh are mostly flat and dominated by silt and clay that influ-

ence porosity, BD, CEC, water holding capacity, drainage, nutrient availability,
pH, etc. These are also important soil health determinants [32]. Effective soil
depth is a good indicator of soil available water and nutrients, but not much is
known for its long term benefit [31]. Our top scoring soil was loamy in texture
(Figure 2(a)), having good depth with 18% - 25% clay, 5% - 40% sand and 5.6 -
6.5 pH. These properties are not universal and vary depending on scoring me-
thods and regions of the world. Gruver and Weil [33] found good soil rating
with 10.5% clay and 45% sand having a pH of 6.5. Soil pH greatly influences sa-
linization, electrical conductivity, exchangeable sodium (Na) and structural sta-
bility [34], nutrient availability [31]. In general, SOC, porosity and aggregate
stability influence SQI values [35]. We have also found good soil aggregate sta-
bility score with higher SOC that ultimately govern soil erosion, surface crapping
and directly or indirectly soil fertility and crop productivity [36].
Final soil health score was divided into eight groups (Figure 3(f)), to be used
effectively as a benchmark for growing different crops. In literature we have
found less grouping viz. five for Cornel Soil Health Assessment [1] that might be
suitable in the USA because of climate and edaphic factors. Since soil quality
rating varies depending on crops to be grown, a good rated soil should have di-
rect linkages with crop productivity. So, the most sensitive soil parameters need
to be identified that impairs crop growth and development severely, which has
been delineated in this report. Similar views were also expressed by Andrews et
al. [37]. The tolerance ability of a crop to certain stress makes it a better choice
for consideration to be cultivated in a particular region. For example, rice can
tolerate salinity of 4 - 6 dS·m–1, water stagnation and even submergence tolerant
varieties are available [38] indicating that they can be cultivated in most places of
Bangladesh except in the areas having the least soil health ratings.
Our efforts to minimize data set requirements for SQI determination though
PCA analysis and its relationships with grain yields of wheat showed lesser cor-
relation coefficients for BD (0.10074), SOC (0.09274), Ks (0.17210), slope
(0.17525), WDCS (0.49144) and drainage (−0.21033) compared to geometric
mean approach (Table 2). Moreover, wheat grain yields as estimated from PCA
derived strong loaded factors showed inferior relationships than multiplicative
regression function response. Similar findings were also reported by Vasu et al.
[12]. They reported that weighted index SQIs were better correlated with crop
yields than additive SQIs for PCA.
The prediction of wheat yield from the soil health rating index appears to be
low, as we could understand that the yield also depends on other biotic and abi-
otic stresses such as temperature, insects, diseases, inputs and agronomic man-
agement practices in different parts of the country. Moreover, all regions are not
suitable for growing wheat, because of unfavorable ecology and unsuitability of
land, although efforts are underway to grow wheat in more areas of Bangladesh.
Besides, dynamic soil properties may change within hours or it may take a pe-
riod of decades depending on many factors of particular localities and thus good
relationships between SQI and grain yield might not be established easily in

some cases.
The efficacy of SQI depends on its acceptance by the end users. Far-
mers/producers generally want a simple technique as was found in the USA,
where farmers related their scoring with soil carbon and soil structure effectively
[33]. Soil color, as influenced by organic matter content and texture are also
good SQI from the farmer’s point of view [39]. In this paper, the aim was pri-
marily to develop a methodology to derive soil health rating index by including
physical, chemical and physico-chemical characters of soils. Our efforts clearly
indicate that SQI developed for Bangladesh can be utilized for proper utilization
of soil resources in terms of crop zoning and delineation of management options
for growing different crops.
5. Conclusion
A method for soil quality assessment has been developed for Bangladesh, which
would be applicable for similar environments around the globe. Thirteen soil
attributes were used in determining SQI. Attribute wise, the lowest score (say 1,
5, 10, 20, etc.) was assigned for the most adverse soil conditions within the scale
of 0 - 100 and the gradually higher score was provided for comparatively favora-
ble crop growing environments. Different approaches for deriving SQI, by deal-
ing with 13 attributes (altogether, most stressed one, most stressed two
attributes, six attributes through PCA) by following additive and multiplicative
regression fits. The indices were related to wheat yields (five years average). It
was clear that multiplicative approach provides better predictability of yield es-
timates. Also, if we take all 13 tested attributes, the performance is not satisfac-
tory, compared to one/two most attributes that severely affect crop growth and
development. Through PCA, six attributes were identified for soil health assess-
ment, but their use for yield estimates could not perform better than the multip-
licative regression approach. In this paper, we have shown the methodology for
SQI determination and established linkage with wheat yields satisfactorily. This
methodology could be useful in irrigation scheduling, nutrients management
options, and resource conservation technologies for sustained agricultural pro-
duction.
