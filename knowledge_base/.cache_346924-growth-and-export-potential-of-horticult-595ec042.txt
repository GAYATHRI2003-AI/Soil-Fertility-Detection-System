ABSTRACT
Cultivation of horticultural crops is the best alternative for Indian agriculture as a farmer can achieve
a higher return by exporting the produce. So the topic has been selected to analyze the trend in export
performance of horticultural crops of India and to identify the major destinations of India for exporting
fruits and vegetables. Data was entirely based on secondary sources, and the major analytical techniques
like CAGR and CV were used to achieve the study’s objective. The trend in export of fresh fruit and
vegetables both by quantity and value shows that walnuts have negative growth rate. Fresh mangoes have
shown a negative growth rate (-4.50%) in terms of quantity. In the case of export of processed fruits and
vegetables by quantity, Cucumber and Gherkins (Prepared & Preserved) have shown a negative growth
rate (-2.21%) along with mango pulp (-5.48%). ’India’s primary market for fresh fruit and vegetables is
United Arab Emirates. For processed fruit and vegetables, the major market are USA, Netherland, Saudi
Arabia, and China. To emerge as a major exporting nation, India needs to produce surplus by cultivating
high-value horticultural crops, improving cultivation practices, pre and post harvest management,
storage, etc.
Highlights
m The growth in export of horticultural crop during the period 2009-18 shows fluctuating trend over
the years.
