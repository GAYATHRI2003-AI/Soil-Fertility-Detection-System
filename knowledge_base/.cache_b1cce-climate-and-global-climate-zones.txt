FACTS ABOUT FACTORS AFFECTING CLIMATE:
°
A fall of 6.5°C occurs with an ascent of 1000 meters or 1.0 C per 165 meters.
°
It takes less energy to raise the temperature of a given volume of land by 1.0 C as compared to same
volume of water body.
Mountains receive more rainfall than low lying areas because as air is forced over the higher ground it
cools, causing moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall.
Dry soils like sands are very sensitive to temperature changes, whereas wet soils, like clay, retain much
moisture and warm up or cool down more slowly.
Mountain ranges that have an east-west alignment like the Alps show a higher temperature on the south-
facing 'sunny slope' than the north facing 'sheltered slope’.
The warmer water pumps energy and moisture into the atmosphere, altering global wind and rainfall
patterns.

SOME FACTS ABOUT HEAT ZONES CLASSIFICATION:
Tropical or Torrid Zone: The sunrays are almost vertical throughout the year. The temperature always
remains high. There is no winter season in this zone.
Frigid Zones: The sunrays in these two zones in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere fall in slanting
form throughout the year. Therefore these zones experience very low temperature and high degree of
coldness.

On the basis of distribution of seasonal rainfall the above types of humidity regions were further divided
into following subdivisions:
Y = Heavy rainfall in all seasons
s = Scarcity of rainfall in summer season
w = Scarcity of rainfall in winter season
d = Scarcity of rainfall in all seasons
After linking precipitation effectiveness and seasonal distribution of rainfall to temperature anomalies,
the climates could be of 120 different types.

Location
Found in the lowlands of the Amazon, the Congo, Malaysia and the East Indies
Bogota Kuala
Lumpur
hot, wet equatorial regions
Climatic Conditions
5-10 degrees North and South of the equator.
Great uniformity of temperature throughout the year (around 27°C).
No winter. Cloudiness and heavy precipitation moderates the daily temperature.
Vegetation
Multitude of evergreen trees that yield tropical hardwood.
Lianas, epiphytic and parasitic plants are also found.

www.visionias.in Vision IAS2. The Tropical Monsoon and Tropical Marine Climates
Location
Tropical Monsoon Climate:
They are best developed in the Indian sub-continent, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, parts of Vietnam
and south China and northern Australia.
Tropical Marine Climate:
It is experienced in Central America. West Indies, north-eastern Australia, the Philippines, parts of East
Africa, Madagascar, the Guinea Coast and eastern Brazil.
Cairns
Tropical marine
Tropical monsoon
Climatic Conditions
Found in the zones between 5° and 30° latitudes on either side of the equator.
The basic cause of monsoon climates is the difference in the rate of heating and cooling of land and sea.
Tropical Monsoon Climate: In regions like the Indian sub-continent which have a true Tropical Monsoon
Climate, three distinct seasons are distinguishable - The cool, dry season (October to February), the hot
dry season (March to mid-June) and the rainy season (mid-June to September).
Tropical Marine Climate: This type of climate is experienced along the eastern coasts of tropical lands,
receiving steady rainfall from the Trade Winds all the time.
Vegetation
Trees are normally deciduous because of the marked dry period, during which they shed their leaves to
withstand the drought.
Where the rainfall is heavy, e.g. in Southern Burma, peninsular India, northern Australia and coastal
regions with a tropical marine climate, the resultant vegetation is forest.
5
www.visionias.in Vision IAS3. The Savannah or Sudan Climate
Location
The Savannah or Sudan Climate is a transitional type of climate found between the equatorial forest and
the trade wind hot deserts
It is confined within the tropics and is best developed in the Sudan where the dry and wet seasons are
most distinct, hence its name the Sudan Climate.
The belt includes West African Sudan, and then curves southwards into East Africa and southern Africa
north of the Tropic of Capricorn.
In South America, there are two distinct regions of savannah north and south of the equator, namely the
llanos of the Orinoco basin and the Campos of the Brazilian Highlands.
Tropic of Cancer
Kang
Lianos
Equator
Salisbury

Tropic of Capricorn
Savanna
Climatic Conditions
It is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons.
The extreme diurnal range of temperature is also a characteristic of Sudan type of climate.
The prevailing winds of the region are the Trade Winds which bring rain to the coastal districts.
The savannah, particularly in Africa, is the home of wild animals. It is known as the 'big game country’.
Vegetation
Tall grass and short trees. The terms 'parkland' or 'bush-veld’ is also used.
The trees are deciduous and show adaptation to withstand drought.

www.visionias.in Vision IAS4. The Hot Desert and Mid-latitude Desert Climates
Location
They include the Sahara Desert, the Great Australian Desert , the Arabian Desert, Iranian Desert, Thar
Desert, Kalahari and Namib Deserts.
In North America, the desert extends from Mexico to USA and is called by different names at different
places, e.g. the Mohave Sonoran, Californian and Mexican Deserts.
In South America, the Atacama or Peruvian Desert (driest). The Patagonian Desert is more due to its rain-
shadow position on the leeward side of the lofty Andes than to continentality

Climatic Conditions
The major hot deserts of the world are located on the western coasts of continents between latitudes 15
and 30 degrees N and S.
The hot deserts lie astride the Horse Latitudes or the Sub Tropical High Pressure Belts where the air is
descending (least favourable for precipitation)
There is no cold season in the hot deserts and the average summer temperature is around 30°C.
Vegetation
Vegetation include grass, scrub, herbs, weeds, roots or bulbs.

www.visionias.in Vision IAS5. The Warm Temperate Western Margin (Mediterranean) Climate
Location
The basic cause of this type of climate is the shifting of the wind belts.
Though the area around the Mediterranean Sea has the greatest extent of this type of 'winter rain
climate', and gives rise to the more popular name Mediterranean Climate.
Other Mediterranean regions include California (around San Francisco), the south-western tip of Africa
(around Cape Town), southern Australia (in southern Victoria and around Adelaide, bordering the St.
Vincent and Spencer Gulfs), and south-west Australia (Swanland).
Mistral
Sirocco
Cape Town
Mediterranean regions
Climatic Conditions
They are entirely confined to the western portion of continental masses, between 30° and 45° north and
south of the equator.
The Mediterranean type of climate is characterized by very distinctive climatic features - a warm summer
with off-shore trades, a concentration of rainfall in winter with onshore westerlies, bright, sunny
weather with hot dry summers and wet, mild winters and the prominence of local winds around the
Mediterranean Sea (Sirocco, Mistral).
Growth is slow in the cooler and wetter season, even though more rain comes in winter. The warm, bright
summers and cool, moist winters enable a wide range of crops to be cultivated Some 85 per cent of
grapes produced, go into wine. The long, sunny summer allows the grapes to ripen and then they are
handpicked. Economy: The area is important for fruit cultivation, cereal growing, wine-making and
agricultural industries as well as engineering and mining.
Vegetation
The Mediterranean lands are also known as the world's orchard lands. A wide range of citrus fruits such as
oranges, lemons, limes, citrons and grapefruit are grown. Wine production is another specialty.
The absence of shade is a distinct feature of Mediterranean lands.

www.visionias.in Vision IAS6. The Temperate Continental (Steppe) Climate
Location
In Eurasia: Steppes. Stretch eastwards from the Black Sea to the Altai Mountains.
In North America: Prairies. They lie between the Rockies and the Great Lakes.
In South America: Pampas of Argentina and Uruguay. Extend right to the sea and enjoy much maritime
influence.
In South Africa: Tropical Bushveld in North and High Veld in the South. They lie between the Drakensberg
and the Kalahari Desert.

Climatic Conditions
Summers are very warm and winters are very cold in the continental steppes of Eurasia because of the
enormous distances from the nearest sea.
In contrast, the steppe type of climate in the southern hemisphere is never severe. The winters are mild.
Temperatures below freezing point are exceptional.
Temperate grasslands are found bordering the deserts, away from the Mediterranean regions and in the
interiors continents.
Their greatest difference from the tropical savannah is that they are practically treeless and the grasses
are much shorter.
Vegetation
Trees are very scarce in the steppes, because of the scanty rainfall, long droughts and severe winters.
Tall, fresh and nutritious prairie grass are found. Granaries of the world.

www.visionias.in Vision IAS7. The Warm Temperate Eastern Margin (China Type) Climate
Location
It can be sub-divided into three main types:
The China type: Central and North China including southern Japan (temperate monsoonal).
The Gulf type: South-eastern United States bordering Gulf of Mexico (slight monsoonal).
The Natal type: The entire warm temperate eastern margin (non-monsoonal areas) of the southern
hemisphere including Natal, eastern Australia and southern Brazil-Paraguay-Uruguay and northern
Argentina.

It has comparatively more rainfall than the Mediterranean climate.
The eastern margins of warm temperate latitudes have a much heavier rainfall than either the western
margins or the continental interiors and thus have luxuriant vegetation.
Vegetation
Lowlands: Evergreen broad-leaved forests and deciduous trees.
Highlands: Conifers such as pines and cypresses that are important softwood.

www.visionias.in Vision IAS8. The Cool Temperate Western Margin (British Type) Climate
Location
Permanent influence of Westerlies through out the year.
They are also regions of much cyclonic activity, typical of Britain.
Climatic belt stretches from Britain to North-West Europe.
In the southern hemisphere, the climate is experienced in southern Chile, Tasmania and most parts of
New Zealand, particularly in South Island.

Climatic Conditions
Summers are never very warm.
Adequate rainfall throughout the year with a tendency towards a slight winter or autumn maximum
from cyclonic sources.
The rain-bearing winds come from the west, the western margins have the heaviest rainfall.
Vegetation
Deciduous forests used for Lumbering
Trees shed their leaves in winter as a protection mechanism.
11
www.visionias.in Vision IAS9. The Cool Temperate Continental (Siberian) Climate
Location
Experienced only in the northern hemisphere where the continents within the high latitudes have a
broad east-west spread.
The Siberian Climate is conspicuously absent in the southern hemisphere because of the narrowness of
the southern continents in the high latitudes.
Churchill
Moscow
coniferous forest
Climatic Conditions
Characterized by a bitterly cold winter of long duration, and a cool brief summer. Spring and autumn are
merely brief transitional periods.
The extremes of temperature are so great in Siberia that it is often referred to as the 'cold pole of the
earth’.
Some of the lowest temperatures in the world are recorded in Verkhoyansk.
Vegetation
Coniferous forests (Softwood)
There are four major species in the coniferous forests – a) Pine, e.g. white pine, red pine b) Fir, e.g.,
Douglas fir and balsam fir, c) Spruce and d) Larch.

www.visionias.in Vision IAS10. The Cool, Temperate Eastern Margin Climate
Location
This climate is found only in two regions.
North American Region: north-eastern North America, including eastern Canada, north-east U.S.A. and
Newfoundland.
Asiatic Region: The eastern coastlands of Asia, including eastern Siberia, North China, Manchuria, Korea
and northern Japan.
In the southern hemisphere, this climatic type is absent because only a small section of the southern
continents extends south of the latitude of 40° S.
Climatic Conditions
This climate has cold, dry winters and warm, wet summers
It has features of both the maritime and the continental climates.
It is an intermediate type of climate between the British and the Siberian type of climate.
Vegetation
The predominant vegetation of the Laurentian type of climate is cool temperate forest.
Oak, beech, maple and birch are the principal trees.
13
www.visionias.in Vision IAS11. The Polar Climate
Location
Two subtypes:
Tundra Climate
Ice-Cap Climate
Climatic Conditions
Exists poleward beyond 70° latitude.
Tundra-Climate [ET] is found in regions with permafrost. Short growing season i.e. summer with very
long duration of day light. Drainage in the tundra is usually poor as the sub-soil is permanently frozen.
The ice cap climate (EF) occurs over interior Greenland and Antarctica. Even in summer, the temperature
is below freezing point.
Vegetation
Tundra vegetation i.e. Mosses, Lichens and flowering plants.
