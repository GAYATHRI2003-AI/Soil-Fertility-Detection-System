XIVExecutive Summary
The Fourth Biennial Update Report (BUR-4) updates the Third National Communication (TNC), which was
submitted to the UNFCCC in December 2023. This report (BUR-4) contains the National Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) inventory for the year 2020.
Key Highlights
India is currently one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, home to almost one-sixth
of humanity. Its growth momentum is integral to global development and essential to meeting
sustainable development goals. Several challenges confront India’s development agenda,
including climate change. India’s contribution to global warming is minimal. Nevertheless, India
is committed to combating climate change by making development choices that ensure the
growth and development of the economy along low-carbon pathways toward net zero by
2070. Recognizing that climate change is a global collective action problem, India is committed
to addressing the challenge with firm adherence to multilateralism based on equity and the
principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC),
as enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
In 2020, India’s total GHG emissions, excluding Land Use Land-Use Change and Forestry
(LULUCF), were 2,959 million tonnes of CO2e and 2,437 million tonnes of CO2e with the inclusion
of LULUCF.
 Emissions by gas: Carbon dioxide - 80.53%; Methane - 13.32%; Nitrous oxide - 5.13%; and
others 1.02%.
 Emissions by sector: Energy – 75.66%; Agriculture – 13.72%; Industrial Process and
Product Use (IPPU) – 8.06%; and Waste – 2.56%.
 In 2020, India's forest and tree cover, along with other land use, sequestered
approximately 522 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to reducing 22% of the country's
total carbon dioxide emissions in 2020.
India has progressively continued decoupling economic growth from GHG emissions. Between
2005 and 2020, India’s emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reduced by 36%.
By October 2024, the share of non-fossil sources in the installed electricity generation capacity
was 46.52%. Total installed capacity of renewable power, including large hydropower, is 203.22
GW and cumulative renewable power installed capacity (excluding large hydro projects) has
increased 4.5 times from 35 GW in March 2014 to 156.25 GW. The installed capacity of various
renewable energy sources as of 31st October 2024 is as follows:
 Solar energy: 92.12 GW (35 times increase from 2.63 GW in March 2014);
 Wind energy: 47.72 GW (more than double the capacity of 21.04 GW in March 2014).
India’s forest and tree cover has consistently increased and currently stands at 25.17% of the
total geographical area of the country. During 2005 to 2021, additional carbon sink of 2.29
billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent has been created.
11. Institutional Arrangement for the preparation
of BUR-4
This report embodies information on national circumstances, the national GHG inventory for the year 2020,
mitigation actions, an analysis of the constraints, gaps, related finance, technology, and capacity-building
needs, information on domestic measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), and additional information.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is the nodal ministry under the
Government of India for coordination and management of climate change-related programs, actions, and
reporting information. MoEFCC, with its cross-ministerial and institutional network, is implementing and
executing matters related to the National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs). India has
furnished its three National Communications (NCs) and three Biennial Update Reports (BURs). The third
National Communication was submitted to UNFCCC in December 2023.
The institutional arrangements for preparing BUR include a National Steering Committee (NSC) and
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The NSC, under the chairmanship of the Secretary, MoEFCC, oversees
the preparation and implementation of the work programme of the BUR. Various Ministries and government
Departments concerned with different information elements in this report have representation in the NSC.
These Ministries and Departments provide inputs for the BUR. The TAC provides technical guidance for the
preparation of the BUR. This committee has members from the government, academia, and civil society.
Several studies were launched for the fourth Biennial Update Report (BUR-4), which were carried out through
a network of scientific and research institutions with sector-specific expertise. The network of institutions
has been expanded since the First Biennial Update Report (BUR-1). Academic and government experts
reviewed the report, and there is thus a robust Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) process in place.
2. National Circumstances
India has a diverse geography, with landscapes ranging from snow-capped mountain ranges to deserts
in the west, plains, hills, plateaus, coastal regions, and islands. It also has climatic conditions ranging from
continental to coastal, extremes of heat to extremes of cold, extreme aridity, and negligible rainfall to
excessive humidity and torrential rain.
The southwest monsoon season is the principal rainy season of the country. June, July, August, and
September constitute the core of the southwest monsoon season in most parts of the country. Still, the actual
period of the monsoon in different regions of the country depends on the onset and withdrawal dates. The
retreat phase of the southwest monsoon is followed by the northeast monsoon, which starts in October and
continues until December. The northeast monsoon is a transition season associated with establishing the
north-easterly wind regime over the Indian Peninsular Region.
On average, about 868.6 mm of rainfall is received nationwide between June and September during the
monsoon season. The southwest monsoon season rainfall contributes 74.0% to the annual rainfall. The pre-
monsoon (March-May) rainfall (130.6 mm) and post-monsoon season (October-December) rainfall (121.0 mm)
contribute about 11% and 10% respectively, to the annual rainfall over India. The winter (January-February)
rainfall (39.8 mm) contributes about 3.4% to the annual rainfall over India. The rainfall during the northeast
monsoon varies from 209.6 to 480.7 mm in the States of the southern peninsula. For these States, the rainfall
received during the northeast monsoon (post-monsoon season) contributes 30% of the annual rainfall.
Although inter-annual variability exists, total precipitation during the Indian summer monsoon has remained
largely stable from 1901 to 2023. It has shown a weak decreasing trend during the recent few decades.
The long-period (1971-2020) average (LPA) rainfall over the country during the monsoon season is 868.6
mm, and the annual average is 1160 mm. The annual rainfall during 2022 was 108% of LPA, while the SW
monsoon season rainfall was 106% of LPA. The annual rainfall during 2023 was 95% of LPA. During the 2023
SW monsoon season, rainfall over the country was normal (94.4% of LPA).
2EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The year 2023 was the second warmest year on record since 1901, with annual mean surface air temperature
+0.65°C above the 1981-2010 period average. Past decades (2013-2022/ 2014-2023) were also the warmest
decades on record, with anomalies of +0.41°C/ +0.46°C. The annual mean temperature during 1901-2023
showed a significant increasing trend of 0.66°C/100 years with a significant increasing trend in maximum
temperature (1.01°C/100 years) and an increasing trend (0.31°C/100 years) in minimum temperature.
State-wise reports on observed rainfall trends and variability based on recent 30-year data (1989-2018)
indicate a significant increasing trend in the number of dry days during the monsoon season over the south
coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, northern parts of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh,
Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. A significant increasing trend in the frequency of
heavy rainfall events is observed over Saurashtra and Kutch, Southeastern parts of Rajasthan, northern
parts of Tamil Nadu, northern parts of Andhra Pradesh and adjoining areas of Southwest Odisha, many
parts of Chhattisgarh, Southwest Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Manipur and Mizoram, Konkan and Goa,
and Uttarakhand.
India's long coastline, with over 7,500 km of flat coastal terrain, a shallow continental shelf, high population
density, particular geographical location, and specific physiographic features, makes it vulnerable to
cyclones and their associated hazards. Thirteen coastal States and Union Territories (UTs) in the country,
encompassing 84 coastal districts, are vulnerable to tropical cyclonic storms.
In 2022, three cyclonic storms formed over the north Indian Ocean: Severe Cyclonic Storm ASANI, Severe
Cyclonic Storm MANDOUS, and Cyclonic Storm SITRANG. All three cyclones formed over the Bay of Bengal,
while the Arabian Sea did not have any cyclonic storms. In 2023, six cyclonic storms formed over the North
Indian Ocean. These include the Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm MOCHA, Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm
BIPARJOY, Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm TEJ, Very Severe Cyclonic Storm HAMOON and Severe Cyclonic
Storm MICHAUNG & MIDHILI. Of these, four cyclones, MOCHA, HAMOON, MIDHILI, MICHAUNG formed over
the Bay of Bengal & 2 cyclones, BIPARJOY, TEJ formed over the Arabian Sea.
Heatwaves typically occur between March and June and, in some cases, even extend until July in India.
They are more frequent over the Indo-Gangetic plains of India. On average, 5-6 heatwave (HW) events occur
every year over the northern parts of the country. Temperatures of more than 46°C have been recorded in
many parts of the country in the past, especially over north and central India. The average Severe Heatwave
(SHW) days of 1-3 days were mainly experienced over the country's northwest, north and eastern parts.
Increasing trends in the HW were observed over most of the stations except a few stations in the plains along
the foothills of the Himalayas, southern parts of central India, and east India, which showed decreasing
trends during the period 1961-2023.
India is one of the few countries where forest and tree cover has continued to increase over the years,
qualifying the country’s forests as net sink owing to national policies aimed at conservation and sustainable
management of forests. As per the India State of Forest Report (2023), India's total forest cover was 7,15,342.61
sq. km, which was 21.76 percent of the geographical area. The tree cover of the country is estimated as
1,12,014.34 sq km, which is 3.41 percent of the geographical area. Thus, the total forest and tree cover of the
country was 8,27,356.95 sq km, which is 25.17 percent of the geographical area of the country.
Climate change impacts have direct consequences for water security. The initiatives undertaken in the
water sector in the last decade reflect the importance of water management in reducing vulnerability and
building climate resilience. Consequently, various government initiatives have focused on issues such as
river rejuvenation, holistic river basin management, increasing storage, enhancing the efficiency of existing
dams, water conservation and recharge, and security of water supply.
The Himalayan glacier systems are an important ecosystem within the Indian sub-continent. which supplies
water to major Indian rivers, including the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. Several studies indicate that overall,
the glacier snout recession has accelerated in the last few decades. In general, Himalayan glaciers are
undergoing thinning and reduction in length and area in the present climate conditions.
Agriculture and allied activities (horticultural crops, livestock, fishing, forestry, and logging) play a significant
role in India's economy and is the largest sector in terms to livelihood and employment. India’s agriculture
3sector has been witnessing robust growth, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6% over the last six years.
At current prices, the share of agricultural and allied sector activities in the economy’s total Gross Value
Added (GVA) is 18.3, 20.4, 18.9, and 18.2 percent for 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23, respectively.
Indian agriculture remains vulnerable to weather vagaries despite self-sufficiency in food grain production.
Climate change and increased extreme weather events in recent decades, as well as uncertainty in
the prediction of those events, further add to the challenges to farmers, causing widespread losses of
agricultural output. Heatwaves and floods have mainly caused significant damage to crop production and
crop harvesting activities in India.
Despite the above factors, there has been a consistent increase in the production of both food grains and
horticultural products in India. This indicates the importance of developing climate-resilient crop varieties,
appropriate farming systems, social security and welfare measures, and other interventions.
India’s economy is on a consistent growth path, with continuing efforts at reform and considerable innovations
in policy and governance across various sectors that have sustained this growth. Poverty eradication and
constant improvement of the ease of living is a priority on India’s economic agenda.
Energy consumption needs to increase by a significant amount to meet India’s developmental goals. In
2022-23 (Provisional), the Primary Energy Supply totalled 8,50,349 Kilo Tonnes of Oil equivalent (ktoe). Two
major contributors to the total energy supply in the country were coal, which accounted for 57.82% of the
total, and crude oil, which accounted for 31.48%. In 2022-23 (P), the final energy consumption (End Use) was
5,51,550 ktoe.
The industrial sector was the largest consumer of energy in the country with this sector itself using 48.95%
of the total final energy consumption. Iron and steel were the sector's most energy-intensive industries,
accounting for 15.15% of the industrial energy use, followed by chemicals and petrochemicals, 4.56 %, and
construction, 1.80%. The consumption of the residential, agriculture, commercial, and public sectors and non-
energy purposes represented 39.34% of the total final consumption in the country. In contrast, the transport
sector accounted for 11.70% of the total final consumption.
The Indian Road network is the second largest in the World, with about 63.45 lakh km, of which 146 lakh
km are national highways and 179 lakh km are state highways. The capacity of National Highways to
handle traffic (passengers and goods) needs to keep pace with economic growth. Indian Railways has the
fourth-largest network in the world and is one of the nation's major electricity consumers. The railroads
run 9,146 freight trains and 13,523 passenger trains per day. Indian Railways ranks seventh globally and is
the country's top employer, with 1.3 million employees. All this makes it clear that railways are an essential
means of communication for transporting people and freight in India.

Since 1994, India has undergone significant economic growth, resulting in an overall increase in greenhouse
gas emissions. From 1994 to 2020, total CO2e emissions (excluding LULUCF) rose by 144 per cent. The
waste sector experienced a growth of 226 per cent from 1994 to 2020, attributed to population growth and
increased industrial activities. However, its contribution to overall emissions consistently hovers around 3
per cent, indicating a relatively low absolute contribution. The energy sector experienced a growth rate of
201 per cent from 1994 to 2020, primarily attributed to the ongoing rise in fossil fuel combustion. During the
same period, the IPPU sector experienced a growth of 132 per cent, whereas the agriculture sector saw an
increase of only 18 per cent (Figure ES 5). From 2000 to 2020, the LULUCF sector exhibited a 135 per cent
increase in greenhouse gas removals.
4. Mitigation Actions
Despite India's contribution to historical emissions and to the current levels of global emissions being very
low, India is committed to addressing climate change with firm adherence to multilateralism and based on
the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-
RC), as enshrined in the UNFCCC. India maintains that operationalizing the principle of equity and climate
justice requires the global carbon budget to be equitably shared among all countries and used responsibly.
Countries' historical and future responsibilities must be framed to limit their cumulative emissions within
their fair share of this budget. Therefore, the fundamental principle that informs India’s climate policy is to
pursue its development goals according to national circumstances while keeping within its fair share of the
global carbon budget.
8EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Government of India has consistently undertaken several initiatives to promote non-fossil fuel based sources
of energy. Owing to these, India stands 4th globally in renewable energy installed capacity, 4th in wind power
capacity and 5th in solar power capacity. Over the past decade, the installed solar energy capacity has surged
from approximately 2.63 GW in March 2014 to around 92.12 GW in October 2024, marking an extraordinary
increase of nearly 35 times. These achievements align with the updated Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs) of India which includes, inter-alia, achieving about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed
capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.
India has progressively continued decoupling economic growth from GHG emissions. Between 2005 and
2020, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) emission intensity reduced by 36%. It also reaffirms India’s
commitment to make a fair and equitable contribution to the global effort to mitigate climate change.
India’s forest and tree cover has consistently increased and currently stands at 25.17% of the total
geographical area of the country. During 2005 to 2021, additional carbon sink of 2.29 billion tonnes of CO2
equivalent has been created.
India's energy security policies are geared towards improving energy supply, improving people's living
standards (in terms of energy consumption), and contributing to climate mitigation based on India’s right to
a fair share of the global carbon budget. Some of the key policies and measures to mitigate GHG emissions
directly or indirectly across the different sectors are listed below.
4.1 Power
India’s per capita electricity consumption remains significantly lower than the world average, at 1331 kWh
per person in 2022-23. India's total electricity consumption reached around 1440.31 TWh in 2022-23, an
increase of about 9.4% from 2021-22.
While coal remains the predominant source of electricity generation in India, RES (renewable energy
sources) have grown by over 10.94 % (not including hydro) in generation and over 14.7 % (not including hydro)
in Installed Capacity in the year 2023-24. As of October 2024, the share of non-fossil fuel-based power
generation capacity in the country is already at 46.52%.
Given India’s growing economy and electricity needs, the challenge of low-carbon development in the power
sector is significant. Despite the multiple challenges of ensuring energy access, affordability, reliability, and
security, India’s efforts for low-carbon development in the power sector have steadily contributed to the
global effort for climate change mitigation.
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) aims to strengthen the electricity distribution
system. Activities include establishing new substations, upgrading old ones, and expanding power lines.
Electrification efforts covered villages nationwide, with off-grid solutions where grid connectivity was
impractical or expensive.
Smart Meter National Program aims to enhance efficiencies for distribution utilities. Smart meters are
crucial for smart grid initiatives to meet the challenges of the newly evolving energy mix for achieving
an uninterrupted 24x7 power supply. Connected via a web-based monitoring system, smart meters reduce
commercial losses, boost revenues and aid power sector reforms. Over 35.75 lakh smart meters have been
installed in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Andaman under this program.
Demand-side management (DSM) programs assist distribution utilities in lowering power purchases from
the wholesale market during peak-load times, thus reducing operational costs. For Phase 1 (2012-17) and
Phase 2 (2021-26) of this program, the peak demand reduction potential is estimated at about 22.9 GW, and
the energy requirement reduction potential is estimated to be 62.6 billion units across 28 distribution utilities.
The Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) has brought a nationwide shift from conventional streetlights
to smart, energy-efficient LEDs. Between 2015 and 2023, this scheme has led to annual energy savings of
8.75 billion kWh with avoided peak demand of 1,459 MW every year. Avoided emissions are estimated at 6.03
million tons of CO2 per year in this period.
9The Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for ALL (UJALA) program is estimated to have led to annual energy
savings of 48.39 billion kWh and avoided peak demand of 9,788 MW annually between 2015 and 2024. During
this period, avoided emissions are estimated at 39.30 million tons of CO2 annually.
The Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme, which targets energy efficiency in selected 239 Thermal
Power Stations, has led to energy savings of 7.72 million tonnes of oil equivalent and avoided emissions of
about 28.74 million tonnes of CO2 till FY 2021-22.
The Indian government has established minimum share of consumption of non-fossil sources by designated
consumers as energy or feedstock and different share of consumption for various types of non-fossil sources
for different designated consumers in respect of electricity distribution license and other designated
consumers, to be in effect till March 2030 under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001. In 2024-25, 29.91% of
total electricity is mandated to be purchased from renewable energy sources, increasing to 43.33% of total
electricity from renewable energy sources till 2029-30.
Along with this, the Government of India is implementing the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
across the nation, with an allocation of ₹24,000 crores for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules.
The total avoided emissions from renewable energy sources in 2023-24 (up to December) amount to 135.61
million tons of CO2, with 57.47 MtCO2 from wind, 69.40 MtCO2 from solar, 2.09 MtCO2 from biomass, and 6.66
MtCO2 from small hydro.
In addition, National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched in 2023, aims to establish India as the global hub for
production, usage and export of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives.
4.2 Industry
The industrial sector is a cornerstone of the Indian economy, contributing significantly to the country's gross
value added. It represents 31% of India’s GDP and employs over 121 million people. In the year 2022-23, the
industrial sector experienced a growth of 6.7%, with manufacturing emerging as a key driver of economic
expansion. Key sectors such as automotive, engineering, cement, textiles, steel, chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
and consumer durables are pivotal in this growth trajectory.
In FY 2022-23, the total final energy consumption by the industrial sector in India was 2,70,000 ktoe (P), making
it the largest energy consumer in the country, accounting for 48.95% of the total final energy consumption.
The industry sector's most energy-intensive subsector was the Iron and Steel sector, accounting for 15.15% of
industrial energy use, followed by chemicals and petrochemicals at 4.56% and construction at 1.80%.
In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the emphasis on energy efficiency within the industrial
sector through initiatives like the Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme. The scheme has evolved through
seven cycles, currently encompassing 13 sectors comprising 1196 Designated Consumers (DC). Overall, the
five PAT cycles (between 2012 – 2022), there has been cumulative energy savings of 3.35 Mtoe in the Cement
industry, 6.14 Mtoe in the Iron and Steel industry, 2.13 Mtoe in the Aluminium industry, 0.33 Mtoe in the Textile
industry, 0.63 Mtoe in the Paper and Pulp industry. In PAT-VII (latest cycle), 707 DCs from various sectors,
Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, Iron and Steel, Pulp and Paper, Textile, Thermal, Commercial buildings
(hotels), Petroleum Refinery, Railways and DISCOMS have been notified with an overall energy saving
target of 8.485 Mtoe. A new Advanced Industrial Technology Demonstration Centre (AITDC), UTPRERAK,
was established at NPTI Badarpur in June, 2023. It will feature non-functional models of energy efficiency
technologies in sectors such as Cement, Iron and steel, Pulp and paper, Textile, and Chlor-Alkali.
Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
project on Promoting Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in Selected MSME Clusters in India has been
developed to promote market environment for introducing energy efficient technologies and enhancing the
use of renewable energy technologies in process applications. It is operational in 23 MSME clusters including
- Hand tools, Ceramics, Dairy, Foundry, Brass.
10EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
4.3 Transport
The transport sector includes roadways, railways, waterways, and airways, listed in order of their contribution
to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). From 2017-18 to 2021-22, the sector's contribution to the Gross Value
Added (GVA) averaged at 4.5% at constant prices. The electricity consumption in railways increased from
19.02 TWh in FY 2017-2018 to 31.81 TWh in FY 2023-24. Likewise, there was an increase in the consumption of
natural gas (40.1%), motor spirit (33.6%), and furnace oil (159.8%). In contrast, the consumption of high-speed
diesel declined (-56.5%) during this period.
However, there is an increasing recognition of the importance of managing demand and adopting innovative
technologies. Modifications in urban structures, behavioural initiatives, circular and shared economies, as
well as digitalization are facilitating systemic shifts that decrease the demand for transport services or
promote the usage of more efficient modes of transportation.
Innovation in technologies includes the surge in electromobility for terrestrial transportation and the
development of advanced biofuels and hydrogen-based fuels for maritime and aerial transport. Low carbon
development of land-based, long-haul, heavy-duty vehicles through battery-electric vehicles (including
Electric Road Systems) and, in specific scenarios, is complemented by hydrogen and biofuel-based solutions
(with medium confidence) is being explored and can become viable in the future.
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms for passenger vehicles, introduced in FY 2017-18 and the
second phase of the norms started in FY 2022-23, aims to reduce overall fuel consumption. These norms,
coupled with standards for heavy-duty and light commercial vehicles, have led to (for FY 2019-20 to 2022-
23) the collective energy savings amounting to 1.88 Mtoe, and the corresponding avoided emissions are
estimated at 4.41 MtCO2.
The Government has introduced various initiatives to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs)
across the country. These efforts include offering tax benefits to EV owners and developing public charging
infrastructure. The flagship program promoting electric mobility in India is FAME (Faster Adoption and
Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles). Currently in its second phase, FAME-II implemented for
three years starting from April 1, 2019, with a budget of 10,000 Cr, supports the electrification of public and
shared transport, including subsidizing e-buses, e-three-wheelers, e-passenger cars, and e-two-wheelers,
alongside developing charging infrastructure to alleviate range anxiety among electric vehicle users.
Between 2018-19 and 2021-22, the collective energy savings amount to 0.142 Mtoe, and the corresponding
avoided emissions are about 0.432 MtCO2 due to the implementation of this scheme.
The Ethanol Blended Petrol program aims to boost biofuel usage in India by blending different types of
biofuels with petrol. The "National Policy on Biofuels" of 2018 and 2022 amendment, set targets to achieve
20% ethanol blending in petrol and 5% biodiesel blending in diesel by 2030. Efforts have intensified, and it's
projected that 20% ethanol blending in petrol will be reached by 2025-26.
Metro Rail development continues to expand, with 700 kilometres of operational track in 18 cities and 900
kilometres under construction across 27 cities.
As on July 25, 2024, 12 Greenfield Airports have been constructed/ operationalised since 2014. 48 airports/
airstrips have been constructed by Airport Authority of India since 2014. With the efforts of the Government
of India, Airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru have achieved Level 4+ as well as higher
Airports International Council (ACI) Accreditation and have become Carbon neutral.
Indian Railways, one of the largest global rail networks covering over 69,000 route kilometers as on 31st
March 2024, plays a vital role in India's transportation sector, ferrying nearly 19 million passengers daily.
Electrification of railways has significantly reduced their dependence on non-renewable sources of energy
and benefits both the environment and efficiency. Schemes such as Three-Phase locomotive technology,
Auxiliary Power Units (APU), Computerized Fuel Management Systems and head-on Generation systems,
LED Lighting, Dedicated Freight Corridors, Alternative fuels, and sustainable solutions have contributed to
the energy conservation and mitigation actions within the Indian Railways.
114.4 Waste
The Waste sector is India's largest contributor to urban emissions after the energy sector. Municipal
authorities mainly control waste management, which is a key focus for city-level efforts to reduce emissions.
To ensure effective waste management, specialized legislation
