Major land degradation problems across the Ethiopian Highlands include soil erosion, soil
nutrient and organic matter depletion and soil acidity. The causes of these problems include
inherent soil characteristics, intense and erosive rainfall events, frequent tillage, limited
adoption of soil fertility and health management measures, poor nutrient recycling due to
competing uses of crop residue and animal manure, sub-optimal and inappropriate
application of organic and inorganic fertilizers, overgrazing, and deforestation.
Many factors underly the causes of these problems. These include growing populations,
poverty and food insecurity, limited market development and/or access, farmers’ lack of
awareness of appropriate and profitable technologies or practices, the high costs of inputs
and lack of credit, and difficulties in achieving effective collective action to manage soil
health and fertility. The challenge for policy makers is to identify and implement appropriate
policies and programmes to effectively address these problems and achieve sustainable
development in the Highlands. In areas with high agricultural potential and high market
access, intensification of crop production using high levels of external inputs maybe
appropriate, whereas in medium and lower potential areas with limited market access, an
integrated crop–livestock system is desirable. This can be achieved using integrated soil
fertility management approach on cultivated land in conjunction with improved management
of grazing and enclosure areas.
As such, the Ethiopian Government remains committed to promoting sustainable soil health
and, fertility management for the benefit of both present and future generations. Improving
soil health and fertility is an essential pre-requisite for achieving the targets set out in the
national development agenda for both increasing agricultural productivity on a sustainable
basis, improving human health and food security. There are several ongoing initiatives
spearheaded by the Ministry of Agriculture to promote and safe-guard soil health in Ethiopia.
These include scaling up the Sustainable Land Management (SLM) programme of which the
Integrated Soil Fertility Management approach is an integral component. It also includes
activities to promote Conservation Agriculture (CA) and increase capacity for Climate Smart
Agriculture (CSA), these being key components of the ongoing Ethiopian Soil management
initiatives.
For these reasons, this updated Technical Manual is welcomed.

Soil fertility is fundamental in determining the productivity of all farming systems. Soil fertility
is commonly defined in terms of the ability of a soil to supply elements essential for plant
growth without a toxic concentration. However, these days, soil fertility is also viewed as an
ecosystem integrating diverse soil functions. It is the combined effects of three major
interacting components: the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of the soil. The
capacity of soils to be productive depends on more than just plant nutrients. The physical,
biological, and chemical characteristics of a soil, for example its organic matter content,
acidity, texture, depth, and water-retention capacity, all influences soil fertility.
Degraded soils, low soil fertility and absence of sustainable soil fertility management
practices are major constraints contributing to low productivity, food shortages and poverty in
Ethiopia. Though water is the primary limiting factor to cultivation in most cultivated lands in
Ethiopia, soil fertility is a close second.
Major causes of soil fertility decline include topsoil erosion, organic matter depletion and soil
acidity. According to IFPRI (2010), the average annual soil loss from agricultural land is
estimated to be 137 tons per hectare per year for the Ethiopian highlands, which is
approximately an annual soil depth loss of 10-13 mm. Soil acidity and aluminum toxicity is
another important challenge affecting soil fertility in Ethiopia. According to Schlede (1989),
over 40% of Ethiopian soils are affected by acidity. Out of this total, 27.7 percent are
moderate to weakly acidic (pH of 5.5 - 6.7); 13.2 percent are strong to moderately acidic (pH
< 5.5) and nearly one-third have an aluminum toxicity problem. Severe organic matter
depletion, driven by competing uses for crop residues and manure as livestock feed and fuel
is another major cause of low soil fertility.
Looking forward, Ethiopia major challenges of increasing population and increasing food
demand necessitates continued gains in both land and labor productivity. Although, in the
longer term, climate change is not expected to affect average yields, the incidences of other
shocks are expected to increase (Dorosh and Minten. 2020). As agriculture transforms from
a relatively low productivity cereal and small-scale livestock farms with low marketed output
toward high productivity, soil health and soil fertility improvements are urgently required.
There are two main approaches to improve soil fertility management (Sánchez 1995). One is
to manage soil fertility and meet plant requirements through external inputs (inorganic
means), while the second (organic means) relies on biological processes of optimizing
nutrient recycling, with little emphasis on external inputs, but maximizing the efficiency of
their use. A more sustainable middle path that combines the best features of both
approaches, Integrated Soil fertility Management (ISFM), is better than either alone. This
includes close crop-livestock integration as well as promoting “Conservation Agriculture”
(CA) and “Climate Smart Agriculture” (CSA) and “Regenerative Agriculture” (RA)
approaches where they are appropriate. For this reason, this updated manual includes
discussion on each with additional new modules or sections on, rainwater harvesting, and
use of biogas slurry.
1MODULE 1: CONCEPTS OF A HEALTHY SOIL
1.1 WHAT IS A HEALTHY SOIL?
Soil is the cornerstone of food security and agricultural development and its care,
restoration, enhancement and conservation is becoming a major global priority. Neglected
soils lose fertility that increasingly lowers yields over time. Smallholder farmers, especially
those that farm on inherently poor soils and lack the resources to invest in their lands,
disproportionately carry the greatest burden. Renewed attention and investment in soils and
sustainable land management, however, can reverse the process of degradation. Embracing
integrated soil management that builds on local and natural resources, with the appropriate
use of targeted inputs and management practices, will provide the care and attention that
Africa’s soils need for long term sustainable and productive use (Montpellier Panel, 2014).
A recent “Soil Atlas of Africa” (Jones et al, 2013) highlights soil degradation as a threat to
about one quarter of the productive land on the continent. This includes desertification and
soil erosion, but most prominent is the decline in soil fertility through loss of nutrients and
organic matter under continuous cropping. At the same time, a growing population and the
need for social and economic development, along with concerns about climate change,
continue to increase demands on agriculture for food, fodder, fuel and fibre. Simply
increasing the amount of land dedicated to agriculture is neither desirable nor feasible.
Instead we need to think about how we can establish and sustain healthy soil, healthy
people and healthy eco-systems. A healthy human population, which includes food and
nutritional security, starts from the soil. In creating a healthy soil, it is necessary to consider
how Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) can increase crop health and yields for
human benefit. At the same time, managing a healthy ecosystem puts soil in a wider context
of managing land and supporting farmers to make improved land use decisions.
A healthy soil, sometimes called a quality soil is described as having favourable physical,
chemical and biological functions. Some farmers describe the health of the soil as “the
power of the soil”. The concept is similar with animals. If a cow is healthy and fertile, it will
produce many calves. The same applies to the soil. A healthy and fertile soil with a good
soil structure and a rich base of nutrients with adequate water and energy from light and
heat will produce good crops and high yields (Figure 1).
Soils form a living system in which the activities of soil organisms create and enhance soil
health and enhance productive capacity. A healthy soil has:
Good soil structure. This means the soil is soft and its particles are well structured,
providing favorable conditions for plant roots to grow. A good structure also provides air to
the roots and helps them to extract nutrients and water from the soil.
Rich base of nutrients. This means that all the different nutrients which plants need for
good growth are available in the soil.
Soil micro-organisms. These carry out the biological processes in the creation of healthy
soil, through symbiotic relationships between plant root systems, soil nutrients and soil
micro-organisms (Chaparro et al, 2012). Functions undertaken by micro-organisms include
decomposition of organic matter, mineralization (or breakdown of soil nutrients), special
2chemical changes (such as nitrification), aggregation thus improving soil structure, antibiotic
production deterring pathogens, nitrogen fixing and toxin breakdown.
Figure 1: Ingredients required for a healthy crop
Soil is made of rock or mineral particles, organic matter, air and water. Between 2-5% is
organic matter, inhabited by millions of living organisms that break down organic compounds
and make them available to the plant. The rest of the solid matter comprises rock or mineral
particles. The texture of the soil is determined by the type and size of mineral particles,
ranging from clay at the smaller end to silt and sand at the largest. The mineral particle size
determines the amount of space around each particle. Clay particles are small and tightly
packed meaning that clay soils will hold water and nutrients but may suffer from poor
drainage and a lack of air needed by plant roots. Conversely, sand particles have pockets of
space around them meaning that sandy soils have better aeration and drainage but tend to
dry out and for nutrients to be leached.
When a soil is compacted, soil organisms and root growth are restricted, because there is
little movement of air and water; hence they are less productive. Healthy soils have a
mixture of small and large particles that enable water drainage and storage, particularly
important in semi-arid and arid areas.
The three characteristics or components of soil health are: physical, chemical and biological.
Soil health refers to the capacity of the soil to perform agronomic and environmental
functions. Healthy soils have favourable physical, chemical and biological properties that
promote plant health and maintain environmental quality. A healthy soil is ‘fit for purpose’.
This means, it is easy to work, friable, holds water and nutrients well and is free draining. It
allows for abundant, healthy root growth and good crop establishment.
Physical soil health. This refers to the friability and hardness of the soil. A physically
healthy soil does not have hard pans or hard setting surfaces. It holds water well, drains well
3and does not restrict root growth. Physical health can be assessed in the field by measuring,
soil texture, bulk density, soil structure (aggregate stability and porosity), water-holding
capacity, infiltration rate, depth to hardpan and depth to water table in the field or laboratory.
Chemical soil health. This means that nutrients are in balance and available to the crop,
the acidity / alkalinity (pH) is in the desired range and there are no problems with salinity or
sodicity. Healthy soils have an optimal amount of nutrients, so that crop growth and yields
are maximised on a resilient and sustainable basis (Conway, 2012). The primary nutrients
required are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, with micro-nutrients also being essential
for crop growth. These include zinc, copper, iron, chloride, manganese and molybdenum.
Chemical soil health can be measured by conducting a soil test mainly Cat-ion exchange
capacity (CEC), pH, plant available nutrient and electrical conductivity (EC).
Biological soil health. This refers to soil life. A healthy soil has more soil organisms than an
unhealthy soil of the same type. Crop residues break down easily and the chemical and
physical health is better. Biological health can be assessed in the field by checking for
organisms and comparing the smell and feel of the soil. A high organic matter or carbon
content for your soil type usually means a healthy soil.
Healthy soils lead to healthy crops, and we can maximise health benefits and sustainable
intensification by carefully choosing the types of crops grown including legumes, fruit and
vegetables. This will help people achieve a well-balanced diet. At the same time, it is
important to understand that agricultural production systems interact in many ways from field
to farm, and from farm to landscape. How we sustain soil health, human health and food
security and healthy eco-systems are some of the most important development questions we
need to answer. A healthy soil is a fertile soil and one of the most important foundations
where we should start.
1.2 MAJOR SOIL FERTILITY PROBLEMS IN ETHIOPIA
Ethiopia faces a wider set of issues in soil fertility beyond chemical fertilizer use, which has
historically been a major focus for extension workers, researchers, policymakers and donors.
If left unchecked, this wider set of issues concerning soil health will limit future output and
growth in agriculture across the country and in some areas, they already limit the
effectiveness of chemical fertilizer. These chemical, physical and biological issues interact
and mainly include topsoil erosion, organic matter depletion and acidity.
Topsoil erosion: This leads to reduced soil water-holding capacity (making it more
susceptible to extreme conditions such as drought) and limited crop emergence, growth,
yield, and rooting depth. These in turn contribute to a vicious cycle of increased rate of loss
of organic matter.
According to Hurni (1993), average soil loss by erosion on cultivated land in Ethiopia was
42 tonnes per hectare per year. Such soil loss through water erosion is always accompanied
by losses of essential soil nutrients. Erosion is selective for fine soil particles, which are
relatively richer in soil nutrients. In line with this, Stoorvogel and Smaling (1990) and UNDP
(2002) reports showed that compared to rates in sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia has the
highest soil nutrient outflow rates of 60 kg ha−1 (30 kg ha−1 nitrogen and 15–20 kg ha−1
phosphorous), while inflows from fertilizers are very low (<10 kg ha−1). In the long term, such
soil nutrient losses by erosion adversely affect soil productivity of the source areas.
4Soil organic matter depletion: Soil organic matter (SOM) is the organic fraction of a soil. It
consists of plant or animal tissue in various stages of breakdown or decomposition. Most
soils contain 2-10 percent organic matter.
Soil organic matter plays a critical role in maintaining the fertility of the soil by increasing
water holding capacity, reducing surface crusting, increasing cat-ion exchange capacity and
acting as a buffer against pH changes in the soil (Pieri 1989, Breman 1998, Powell and
Unger 1997). However, organic materials necessary for maintaining soil organic matter are
often not available in ample supply, and are often used for competing purposes, such as
building material, animal feed, or fuel. Organic inputs can be attractive sources of nutrients in
the sense that they are usually produced locally, and it may be less costly to apply than
manufactured fertilizer.
Soil organic matter depletion is a widespread problem in Ethiopia. Investigation made by
Zeleke et al. (2010) indicates that many soils of the different areas of the country are rated
low, concerning their organic matter content. Depletion of soil organic matter is driven by
competing uses for crop residues and manure as livestock feed and fuel. Burning of dung
cake and crop residues is common due to a lack of widely available and affordable fuel
wood. Dung cake has been reported to account for about 50 percent of households’ fuel
supply, particularly in the north and central highland cereal zones, and in some areas,
manure is used as a source of supplementary cash income. Zinash and Seyoum (1989)
reported that 63 percent of cereal straws were used for feed, 20 percent for fuel, 10 percent
for construction, and 7 percent for bedding.
Soil Acidity: When soil pH is lower than optimal (5.5 and below), it can be described as
acidic. In this case, the solubility of nutrients needed for growth is reduced leading to
deficiency in N, P, K, Mg, Ca and Mo. These conditions also usually lead to Al and Mn
toxicity. This has multiple implications for plant growth and other soil fertility issues, such as
lack of or reduced response to Ammonium Phosphate and Urea fertilizers, stunted root and
plant growth due to nutrient deficiency, increased incidence of disease, and toxicity, such as
for Mn, causing black spots and streaks on leaves). Crop yields are frequently reduced by
50 percent and even to total crop failure.
The cause of soil acidity could be the type of parent materials from which the soil is formed,
leaching of base forming cations, continuous use of acid forming fertilizers such as Urea and
DAP (Cook, 1982). Soil acidity is further aggravated by leaching and continuous removal of
basic cations through crop harvest. According to Schlede (1989), over 40% of Ethiopia’s
soils are affected by acidity, with 28 percent being moderately to weakly acidic (pH of 5.5 -
6.7); 13 percent being strongly to moderately acidic (pH < 5.5) and nearly one-third having
aluminium toxicity problems (Schlede, H., 1989). Areas well-known to be severely affected
by soil acidity include Ghimbi, Nedjo, Hossana, Sodo, Chencha, Hagere-Mariam, Endibir
and Awi Zone of the Amhara regional state (MoARD and MoFED 2007).
1.3 THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER IN MAINTAINING SOIL HEALTH
Soil organic matter is the fraction of the soil that includes plant and animal residues at
various stages of decomposition; plant roots; cells and tissues of soil organisms; and
substances synthesized by the soil population. Fresh or undecomposed plant materials such
as litter and straw and animal dung lying on the soil surface are not included in this definition
although upon decomposition, these will eventually become part of the soil organic matter.
5Organic matter is largely made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,
phosphorus and sulphur. It is expressed as a percentage of the soil mass that is less than
two mm in diameter. Soil organic matter is a dynamic mixture that reflects the balance
between additions of new organic matter and losses of organic matter already in the soil. It
exists in various forms, which differ in their biodegradability or resistance to decomposition
and are generally divided into three pools: active, intermediate or slow, and recalcitrant or
resistant. The active pool includes microbial biomass and labile organic compounds that
make up less than five percent of the soil organic carbon. The slow pool usually makes up
20 to 40 percent. These three pools have different rates of turnover. The active pool ranges
from months to years, the slow pool in decades, and the recalcitrant pool in hundreds to
thousands of years.
The active and part of the intermediate pools are involved in nutrient supply and in the
binding of small soil particles together to form larger structural units called aggregates.
Aggregation is important for water infiltration, aeration and drainage, and reduces the soil’s
susceptibility to erosion. On the other hand, the recalcitrant pool or humus possesses a large
quantity of negative charges and contributes largely to the nutrient holding capacity (cation
exchange capacity) of the soil. It also imparts a dark colour to topsoil.
The biggest difference between soil and rock is the presence of organic matter and the
associated biological activity that takes place in the former. Soil organic matter is at the heart
of healthy and productive soils. Although organic matter typically makes up a small
percentage of most mineral soils (less than 10 percent by weight), it is especially important
because it positively influences or modifies the effects of almost all soil properties.
Understanding the role of organic matter in maintaining a healthy soil is essential to ensure a
high level of productivity and to minimize the negative environmental impacts of farming
activities.
Organic matter serves several functions, the most important of which are as a soil
conditioner and as a source of plant nutrients. Organic matter adds body to sandy soils and
increases its moisture and nutrient-holding capacity. It promotes granulation in clayey soils
which helps in plant root penetration and entry of water and air into the soil. It makes
cultivation easier, resulting in better seedbeds and reduced surface crusting that can
adversely affect the emergence of seedlings. The functions of soil organic matter are broadly
categorized into biological, physical and chemical but they overlap and interact with each
other.
Biological functions: Organic matter is a food and energy source for soil organisms and a
source of plant nutrients. Organic matter decomposition is a microbiological process which
releases inorganic forms of nutrients including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and sulphur, which
slowly become available for plant use. The humus which develops as an intermediate
product of this decomposition also acts as a store for nutrients. Soil organic carbon is
generally highly correlated with total N. Therefore, the amount of N mineralization,
conversion of organic N compounds to ammonium N, increases as soil organic carbon
increases.
Organic matter also provides active absorption sites for the deactivation of organic
chemicals such as pesticides, particularly herbicides. Micro-organisms associated with soil
organic matter may also rapidly decompose soil-applied organic chemicals.
6Adding organic matter to the soil contributes a certain level of carbon from the atmosphere.
This is currently an active area of research by scientists concerned with increasing the
carbon content of soils to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and to potentially
utilize it in emission trading schemes.
Physical functions: One of the major effects of organic matter is improvement of soil
structure. Plant roots, earthworms, bacteria, fungi and other micro-organisms release
organic compounds which help bind soil particles together to produce stable aggregates.
This improves aeration and increases permeability which in turn makes the soil less
susceptible to erosion. Stable aggregates also resist compaction caused by ploughing and
animal traffic.
Organic substances have been shown to hold up to five times their own weight of water. This
contributes to improving the available water-holding capacity of soil, making growing plants
less prone to short-term droughts.
Chemical functions: Organic matter possesses a high surface area and contains lots of
negative charges. These negative charges contribute to the nutrient retention capacity of
soils by attracting positively charged ions (cations) in soil such as calcium, magnesium,
potassium, ammonium, etc. These would otherwise leach and be lost from the soil profile. It
should be noted that negatively charged ions (anions) such as nitrate and sulphate are not
held by the negative charges of organic matter and are therefore still subject to leaching
loss.
Organic matter acts as a chemical buffer by resisting rapid change in pH. This mechanism
delays soil acidification particularly in soils subjected to long-term fertilization with urea and
ammonium-containing fertilizers However it may be necessary to apply larger quantities of
liming material to raise the pH of an already acidic soil to a desirable level.
The concepts, principles and details of each practice and technology are presented in the
modules which follow. Scaling out involves creating adaptive models of each set of practices
that will serve as demonstrations for learning and practical advice through the establishment
of focal points for farmers, farmer organisations, communities and local government that
encourage adoption and further adaptation. In doing so it is essential that both biophysical
and socio-economic challenges are understood and addressed. This includes measures that
both that address long term trends and protect against future shocks.
7MODULE 2: INTEGRATED SOIL FERTILITY
MANAGEMENT
2.1 CONCEPT AND PRINCIPLES
Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) represents a set of soil fertility management
practices that includes both the use of inorganic fertilisers and organic inputs as well as
improved germplasm or seed. These need to be combined with the knowledge of how to
adapt these practices to local conditions aimed at maximising agronomic use efficiency of
the nutrients as well as improving crop productivity. Inputs need to be managed following
sound agronomic principles (Vanlauwe et al, 2014). This involves the use of carefully
calculated combinations of inorganic and organic fertilisers in association with
complementary agronomic practices including tillage, rotation and crop sequencing, as well
as soil and moisture conservation.
The flow of nutrients, organic matter and manures around a farm represents a system of
nutrient cycling and recycling (Figure 2). Inorganic nutrients can be purchased and,
increasingly, it is possible to access organic nutrients outside the farm. The objective of
ISFM is to utilize both the available organic and inorganic sources of nutrients in a judicious
and efficient manner. Optimal nutrient cycling is essential, the aim being to create a tight
system that synchronizes the release of nutrients by the soil with the demands of the crop.
At the same time, ISFM seeks to minimize nutrient losses that occur due to volatilization, soil
erosion and runoff, leaching, burning, and immobilization within the soil.
Figure 2: Typical flow of nutrients, organic matter and manure around the farm
8In natural ecosystems nutrients continually recycle. For instance, those collected from the
soil by the roots of plants, contribute to the growth of stems, leaves and fruits and when the
plants die, they are returned to the soil as the vegetation rots. Similar recycling also supports
animal populations. Nutrients such as nitrogen are ingested as the animal graze and are
partly returned as manure and urine, and partly returned when the animal dies and
decomposes. As all farmers recognise, when plants are harvested and animals are kept for
milk and meat, the process of harvesting removes nutrients from the ecosystem. While
some soils are naturally richer in nutrients than others and can be mined, at least for a while,
eventually the soils lose nutrients, which must be replaced. Without nutrient replacement
there can be no agricultural sustainability (Conway, 2012).
A key aspect of ISFM is the maintenance of or an increase in soil organic matter. Organic
nutrient sources include legumes, leguminous green manure cover crops, crop residues,
mulches, manure and urine, composts and household waste, all of which have been
discussed in earlier sections. In an intensive cropping system, recycling and reusing
nutrients from organic sources may be insufficient to sustain high crop yields. In these
situations, nutrients removed from the soil, through harvested biomass, must be replenished
from external sources. Thus, the use of adequate inorganic fertilisers is essential to maintain
soil fertility. ISFM is therefore an important strategy for enhancing soil nutrients through the
combined use of both organic and inorganic fertilisers. At the same time other crop
management practices including tillage, rotations and moisture conservation practices play
an important role in ISFM. It is also important that improved crop varieties are used to obtain
increased yields.
While chemical fertilisers can release nutrients immediately for plant uptake, organic
fertilisers play a more important role for improving soil water retention and soil structure. In
addition, organic fertilisers release nutrients slowly during the growing stages of a crop. Well-
managed organic manures are often rich in Nitrogen, but deficient in Phosphate. Hence
there is a need to add mineral phosphate fertiliser in appropriate amounts when organic
manures are primarily used.
Organic fertilisers, made at or near the farm and generated from natural resources, are
usually inexpensive in cash terms. They can significantly increase yields especially on poor
soils and in some cases give better yields than inorganic fertilisers. In most situations they
are good partial replacements. Their main disadvantage is a high labour demand for their
creation.
Unfortunately, arguments about fertiliser are often strongly polarised. On the one hand,
some people claim that the only way to increase yields is to use large quantities of inorganic
fertiliser and that promotion of the use of organic fertilisers will condemn many poor farmers
to continuing low yields. Opponents of this view regard inorganic fertilisers as harmful and
can trap farmers in high cost production systems. Although there is some truth in both
arguments, exclusive use of inorganic fertiliser is often associated with long term yield
decline. Where labour or locally available biomass is a constraint, use of organic fertilisers
may be insufficient to produce high yields and putting organic matter back into the soil is a
high priority. In this situation, targeted minimal use of inorganic fertiliser will be necessary to
obtain high yields. The approach lies in ISFM, assessing each situation in agronomic, socio-
economic and ecological terms to determine the appropriate mix of nutrients (Conway 2012).
9Clearly there is a need to increase the production of biomass to produce organic manure.
Although inorganic fertiliser can be purchased, organic compost or manure needs to be
produced on farm. It should however be noted that in some areas, local markets for organic
wastes are developing. These include waste products from agro-processing industries,
which can be used for manure and compost production.
The integration of different technologies and practices acceptable to and profitable for
farmers is the basis of ISFM. Only if several component technologies are used
simultaneously will farmers achieve the required magnitude of changes for sustainable
farming. Examples include increasing biomass production, using earthworms to convert poor
quality biomass into high quality compost or producing additional biomass to increase
livestock productivity and manure production. This requires that manure and urine need to
be collected and stored and then applied effectively.
2.2 A NUTRIENT BUDGET CALCULATION
Undertaking a nutrient budget calculation is an agronomic assessment of the nutrients
required for any crop. An example based on a small farm growing one hectare of a high
yielding maize cultivar is shown. In this example the farmer has available, one 50 kg bag of
Formula 5 and another of urea, as well as three tonnes of FYM in his backyard. Formula 5 is
an inorganic blended fertiliser, currently produced in Ethiopia and recommended for many
crops in the country. It contains N, P, K, S, Zn, and B. Urea, also an inorganic fertiliser
contains Ammonium Nitrate (46% N). The FYM contains N, P and K. All this is to be
applied to one ha of maize, the FYM before planting, the Formula 5 at planting and the urea
as topdressing when the maize is knee-high.
Nutrients applied: 100 kg or one quintal of Formula 5 is blended to contain 13 kg of N, 26.1
kg of P2O5, 13.7 kg of K2O, 5.6 kg of S, 1.7 kg of Zn and 0.5 kg of B. This is equivalent to
13 kg of N, 11.48 kg of P, 11.37 kg of K, 5.6 kg of S, 1.7 kg of Zn and 0.5 Kg of B in each 50
kg bag. 50 kg of urea contains 23 kg of N.
Therefore 50 kg of Formula 5 and 50 kg of Urea provides the following nutrients:
• Formula 5: 6.5 kg of N (13% x 50), 5.7 kg of P (26% x 50 x 0.44), 5.7 kg of K
(13.7% x 50), 2.8 kg of S (5.6% x 50), 0.85 kg of Zn and 0.25 kg of B (0.5% x 50).
• Urea: 23 kg of N (46% x 50).
Analysis of a sample of the FYM shows that the manure contains 0.8% N, 0.2% P and 0.6%
K. Thus, the three tonnes of FYM used contains 24 kg N, 6 kg P and 18 kg K.
The total nutrients added to the soil are the sum of the organic and inorganic fertilisers
applied before, at and after planting. Thus, the amount of each nutrient applied as calculated
above is:
• N (6.5 + 23 + 24) totalling 53.5 kg per hectare.
• P (7.5 + 6) totalling 13.5 kg P per hectare.
• K (5.7+18) totalling 3.7 kg of K per hectare.
Nutrient losses from volatilisation and leaching: Although most of the nutrients added to
the soil are taken up by plants, some are lost through volatilisation, leaching and/or erosion
and some are retained in the soil. Therefore, not all the nutrients can be recovered by the
crop. Losses can be estimated as follows, based on a few assumptions.
10• Volatilization: Out of the 23 kg of N added through the urea, 25% is lost through
volatilization that is a loss of 5.75 kg.
• Leaching: About 10% of the K added is lost through leaching, thus a loss of 2.37 kg.
• Erosion: Loss of P through erosion is considered negligible since the farm has well-
maintained terraces.
After accounting for these losses, the remaining nutrients available to the plant for the one
hectare of maize are: 47.75 kg of N, 13.5 kg of P, and 21.33 kg of K.
Nutrient removal with the maize harvest: Harvesting maize grain removes nutrients from
the farm. Farmers also often remove maize stover for feeding to livestock. One tonne of
grain and stover contains 24 kg of N, 4 kg of P and 23 kg of K per ha. Assuming that 4.5
tonnes per hectare of maize grain and stover are harvested, this would remove 108 kg N, 18
kg P and 103.5 kg of K from the farm. Deducting the lost nutrients from those added would
leave a negative balance. The results summarized in Table 1, show that there is a net loss of
N, P and K. Therefore, the system requires replenishment of the lost nutrients; otherwise the
farm’s production will decline.
Table 1: Nutrient budget calculation (kg per hectare)

nutrient removed: used & balance
Formula FYM Urea Total losses grain & stover lost

N 6.5 24 23 53.5 5.75 108.0 113.75 -60.25
P 7.5 6 - 13.5 - 18.0 18.0 -4.5
K 5.7 18 - 23.7 2.37 103.5 105.85 -79.80
Hence, the farmer should look for and plan for an additional supply, especially for Potassium
and Nitrogen. Alternatives to be considered include the use of crop residues, green
manures, intercrops with legumes, agro-forestry, biomass transfer from elsewhere on the
farm, compost preparation and use.
This example of a nutrient budget emphasizes the importance of both organic and inorganic
fertiliser for increased food production. The fertility of some soils can be maintained if good-
quality organic fertilisers are available in sufficient quantities, but many soils need the
addition of inorganic fertilisers, and sometimes lime to correct the pH to maintain high yields.
Farmers relying solely on organic fertilisers face the problem of scarcity of organic materials
as well as the variable quality of purchased fertiliser, depending on the source and the way
the materials are handled.
2.3 SELECTING APPROPRIATE ISFM TECHNOLOGIES
There have been decades of research on soils and experience, which demonstrate that
blanket solutions are often not appropriate. The high variability of soils and rainfall means
that soils respond to inputs in different ways with distinct variations in input responsiveness.
An important lesson is that a highly context-specific approach is required that considers not
only the fertility status of the soil and the availability of organic inputs but also the farmer’s
ability to access and pay for inputs.
11Since there are alternative ISFM practices for managing soil, nutrients and water, these
should not only
