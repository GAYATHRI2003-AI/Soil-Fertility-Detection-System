22 2 Abstract
222
22 2 Soil fertility mapping is a scientific approach essential for sustainable soil health management
222 and agricultural productivity in India. It involves assessing spatial variations in soil nutrients and
222 properties using laboratory analysis, Geographic Informati on Systems (GIS), and remote sensing.
22 2
Historically, soil surveys began in the 1950s, advancing w ith initiatives like the Soil Health Card
222
Sch eme. Modern methodologies include Digital Soil Mapping (DSM), which applies machine
222
learning for high-resolution fertility prediction. Satellites such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 provide
222
critical data on vegetation and land conditions. Benefits include optimized fertilizer use, increased
222
yields, and environmental protection. However, challeng es such as data inconsistency, limited
222
infr astructure, and low farmer awareness persist. Future prospects lie in AI integration, real-time
222
222
digi tal platforms, and enhanced policy support for precision agriculture in India. This scientific
approach is essential for ensuring soil health, achieving food security, and fostering climate-resilient
222
agricultural development in India.
