PREFACE
The Indian Horticulture has grown exponentially over the years and the fruits and
vegetable production has surpassed the food grain production of the country and reached
the all time high of 315 million tonnes during 2018-19 which is the second largest next to
China. Such a phenomenal achievement is made possible amidst a bundle of constraints
such as declining per capita arable land availability, occurrence of regular droughts, low soil
organic carbon, multi-nutrient deficiencies besides people quitting farming.
The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, plays a role in developing
improved crop varieties and hybrids in fruits, vegetables, spices & plantation crops,
medicinal crops besides flowers, technologies and farm mechanization. The varieties and
technologies are well received by farmers across the country and TNAU serves as the torch
bearer of cutting edge technologies like nanotechnologies for the preservation of fruits and
vegetables. The technology package deserves continued revision and update to ensure
recent technologies are infused for adoption. In this context, the TNAU under the dynamic
leadership of the Vice Chancellor, Director of Research and other technical directors, the
“Crop Production Guide (CPG) – Horticulture 2020” was updated and ready for
adoption by the farmers of the State of Tamil Nadu.
The CPG - Horticulture 2020 carries complete package of practices of crops
including varieties / hybrids, management techniques & technologies, protected cultivation
of crops, drip fertigation, nematode management, integrated weed management practices,
technology capsule for pests and diseases management, labour saving farm machineries and
post-harvest management practices.
I take this opportunity to thank the Vice Chancellor, Director of Horticulture and
Plantation Crops, Director of Research, Dean (Horticulture) other Technical Directors and
Department officials for their tireless efforts to bring out the document that serve as the
base for the growth and development of horticulture and allied sectors in the State of Tamil
Nadu.

Canopy management
Remove rootstock sprouts and low lying branches nearer to ground to facilitate easy
cultural operations. Remove overlapping, intercrossing, diseased, dried and weak branches in
old trees to get good sunlight and aeration. Carry out judicious pruning of the internal
branches during August – September, once in three years. Do not allow flowering upto three
years by removing the inflorescences as and when they appear. Retain two healthy shoots
by trimming away the weak shoots among the crowded terminal shoots during August-
September annually. Prune back 20 cm of annual growth of the terminals immediately after
harvest.
Top working of senile orchards for rejuvenation
Use scions of choice varieties like Alphonso and Banganapalli for top working. Behead
the trees to be top worked during July- August leaving the main trunk at a convenient height
and allow for new shoots to develop. Adopt cleft method of grafting or softwood grafting on
the emerging shoots from the cut end of the main stem during September- October.
Growth regulators
Spray NAA @ 20 ppm at flowering to increase the fruit set and retention. During
February 0.5% Urea (5 g / lit.) or 1% Potassium nitrate (10 g / lit.) may be sprayed to induce
flowering, if trees do not flower by that time. Spray 2% KNO at mustard size to increase fruit
3
size and retention of fruits. Spray 2 % sulphate of potash at pea stage and 15 days after to
improve yield and quality.
During off year Paclobutrazol @ 0.75 g a.i. per metre of canopy radius in full bearing
tree during first fortnight of September to get maximum number of fruits and yield.
Off-season crop induction
This technology is recommended only for irrigated conditions to shift production from
on- season to off- season. To induce off-season flowering, heading back of 10 cm terminal
growth after the emergence of new growth (vegetative and floral growth) during December -
January along with soil application of Paclobutrazol @ 0.75g a.i. per tree during March - April
is recommended for mango cv.Neelum. Keeping good soil moisture conditions and nutrient
health status of the plant are very important when Pacloburazol application is resorted.

Selection and pre-treatment of suckers
Select sword suckers of 1.5 to 2.0 kg weight, free from diseases and nematodes.
Trim the roots and decayed portion of the corm, cut the pseudostem leaving 20 cm from
the corm and grade the suckers to size. To avoid wilt disease, infected portions of the corm
may be pared, dipped for 5 minutes in carbendazim 0.1% (1 g in 1 lit of water) for Rasthali,
Monthan, Neyvannan, Virupakshi and other wilt susceptible varieties. Pralinage with 40 g of
carbofuran 3CG granules per sucker (Dip the corm in slurry solution of 4 parts clay plus 5 parts
th
water and sprinkle carbofuran to control nematodes). Sow sunhemp on 45 day; incorporate
it after about a month. This operation reduces nematode build up. Use well hardened tissue
cultured banana plants with 5-6 leaves. At the time of planting, apply 25 g Pseudomonas
fluorescens / plant.

Aftercultivation
Garden Land
Give spade digging at bi-monthly intervals and earth up. Prune the suckers at monthly
intervals. The dry and diseased leaves are removed and burnt to control the spread of leaf
9spot diseases. Male flowers may be removed a week after opening of last hand. The plants at
flowering may be propped. Cover the peduncle with flag leaf to prevent stalk end rot. Cover
the bunches with banana leaves to avoid sun scald.
Wet land
th
Form trenches in between alternate rows and cross trenches at every 5 row. The
trenches are periodically deepened and the soil is spread over the bed. Surface diggings may
be given at bi-monthly intervals and desuckering at monthly intervals. Remove the male flower
a week after opening of last hand. Prop plants at or prior to flowering. Cover the peduncle with
flag leaf and the bunch with leaves to avoid sun scald. For ratoon crops, in respect of
Poovan, Monthan and Rasthali, allow the follower at flowering of the mother plant and remove
the other suckers at harvest.
Perennial banana
Give surface digging with spade once in two months. Give one deep digging with
spade during January – February. Other operations as in garden land.
Hill banana
Give four forkings in January, April, July and October. Remove outer sheaths to keep
the corm inside the soil and ward-off borer. Maintain two bearing plants and two followers per
clump along the contour.
Growth regulators
To improve the grade of bunches, 2,4-D at 25 ppm (25 mg / l.) may be sprayed in
Poovan and CO 1 banana after the last hand has opened. This will also help to remove
th th
seediness in Poovan variety. Spray CCC 1000 ppm at 4 and 6 month after planting.
th th
Spray Plantozyme @ 2ml / l at 6 and 8 month after planting to get higher yield.
Micronutrients
Spray micronutrients viz., ZnSO
4
(0.5%), FeSO
4
(1.0%), CuSO
4
(0.2%) and
H BO (0.2%) at 3rd, 5th and 7th MAP to increase yield and quality of banana. Apply 25 kg

basally.
Bunch cover
Use transparent recyclable polyethylene sleeves with 2% (during cool season) and 4%
(during summer season) ventilation to cover the bunches immediately after opening of the last
hand
Intercropping
Leguminous vegetables, beetroot, elephant foot yam and sunnhemp. Avoid growing
cucurbitaceous vegetables.
Special Practices
 Mulching with 100µm degradable polythene sheet immediately after planting conserves soil
moisture and also suppresses weed growth. Surface digging and earthing up of soil at bi-monthly
intervals facilitates better root system. Desuckering should be done at monthly intervals. Removal
of dried leaves at periodical intervals reduces the disease spread. At the time of bunch
emergence, prop the plants using bamboo or casuarina poles. After the completion of female
phase, remove the male bud for better fruit development. After opening of the last hand, withered
styles and perianth to be removed to avoid finger tip disease.
 Bunch thinning i.e., removal of one to two small bottom hands from the bunch (keeping only 7 to 8
hands) facilitates uniform bunch development and this practice is recommended for export
purpose. Cover the peduncle with flag leaf to prevent main stalk end rot. Cover the bunch with
degradable polythene sleeves (2 - 4 % ventilation) or with white colour non-woven UV stabilized
10polypropylene sleeves to avoid sunscald and to produce quality bunch. After harvesting, the
pseudostem should be cut leaving a stump of about 0.6m height to nourish the developing
daughter sucker.

fluorescens (Pf1) liquid formulation @ 4 lit/ha @ 2nd , 4th and 6th month after planting through
drip system to manage panama wilt and nematode complex.
11Diseases
Selection and pre-treatment of suckers
 Select sword suckers of 1.5 to 2.0 kg weight, free from diseases and nematodes. Trim
the roots and decayed portion of the corm, cut the pseudostem leaving 20 cm from the
corm and grade the suckers to size. To avoid wilt disease, infected portions of the
corm may be pared, dipped for 5 minutes in carbendazim 0.1% solution (1 g in 1 l of
water) solution for Rasthali, Monthan, Neyvannan, Virupakshi and other wilt
susceptible varieties.
 Pralinage with 40 g of carbofuran 3 CG granules per sucker (dip the corm in slurry
solution of 4 parts clay plus 5 parts water and sprinkle carbofuran to control
nematodes).
 Sow sunnhemp on 45th day; incorporate it after about a month. This operation reduces
nematode build up.
Sigatoka leaf spot
 Remove affected leaves and burn
 Spray carbendazim @ 1 g/l or benomyl @ 1 g/l or mancozeb @ 2 g/l or copper
oxychloride @ 2.5 g/l or ziram @ 2 ml/l or chlorothalonil @ 2 g/l at monthly interval
from November onwards
 Alternatively spray propiconazole @ 1 ml/l or 0.5 ml/l along with petroleum based
mineral oil @ 10 ml/l or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 0.5% three times at 15 days
interval to control sigatoka leaf spot incidence. Always add 5 ml of wetting agent like
Sandovit, Triton AE, Teepol etc. per 10 l of spray fluid.
CIB recommendation
 Spray pyraclostrobin 133 g/l + epoxiconazole e 50g/l SE @ 3 g/l or tebuconazole 50%
+ trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 300 g/ha
Panama Disease (Fusarium wilt)
 Uproot and destroy severely affected plants
 Apply lime at 1 – 2 kg in the pits after removal of the affected plants
 Corm injection: Remove a small portion of soil to expose the upper portion of the
corm. Make an oblique hole at 45° angle to a depth of 10 cm. Immediately insert a
gelatin capsule containing 60 mg of carbendazim or of 50 mg of Pseudomonas
fluorescens or inject 3 ml of 2 % carbendazim solution into the hole with the help of
‗corm injector‘ on 2nd, 4th and 6th months after planting
 Apply press mud at 5 kg per plant to reduce the wilt incidence or apply
Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf1) liquid formulation @ 4 l/ha at 2nd, 4th and 6th months
after planting through drip system to manage panama wilt and nematode complex.
Cigar end rot
 CIB recommendation: Spray mancozeb 75% WP @1.5-2.0 kg/ha
Bunchy-top
 Use virus-free suckers for planting
 The banana aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa is the vector of bunchy-top virus disease
 Destroy virus affected plants by inserting a gelatin capsule containing 200 mg 2,4 - D
into the corm 7 cm deep using capsule applicator or inject 5 ml 2,4 - D solution (125
gm/lit of water) into the pseudostem by using the injection gun. The plant collapses and
topples in 3 – 5 days

Varieties: PKM 1, VRM 1 Tahithi lime, Balaji (Tenali), Vikram, Rasraj, NRCC -7, NRCC -8 ,
Phule Sharbathi
Soil and Climate: Areas with dry climate and moderate rainfall (<750 mm) are best suited.
Deep well drained medium black, loamy or alluvial soils rich in organic matter and devoid of
calcium carbonate are good. The optimum pH is 6.5 -7.0
Season: December – February and June – September.
Propagation: Budded plants on Rough lemon or Rangpur lime rootstocks are good. Since
seeds are highly polyembryonic and seedlings are true to type, propagation by seeds is also
recommended. Layering is adopted for VRM 1 Tahithi lime.
Planting: Healthy seedlings are planted during June to December at 6 x 6 m spacing in 75
cm x 75 cm x 75 cm pits.
Irrigation: Young plants need regular watering during post-monsoon period at an interval of
8-10 days and at 5-7 days during summer months. Water is applied around the periphery of
the tree in a ring and basin system (double ring) so that tree trunk should not come in direct
contact with water. Avoid water stagnation. Adopt drip system for new plantations.

After cultivation: Remove branches of main stem up to 45 cm from ground level. Periodical
removal of dried twigs along with one inch length of basal green wood and destroying them
by
burning should be done. Spray Zinc sulphate @ 0.5% (500 g /100 lit of water) thrice in a
year (March, July and October) after the emergence of new flushes.
The basins should be mulched with dry leaf waste or paddy husk with about 10 cm thickness
so as to arrest weed growth and also to conserve soil moisture, thereby improving the fruit
quality.
Intercropping: Legumes and vegetable crops can be raised during pre-bearing age.
Growth regulator: To increase fruit set, spray 2, 4 – D @ 20 ppm (200 mg / 10 l) during
flowering. For fruit retention, spray 2, 4 – D @ 20 ppm or NAA 30 ppm (300 mg / l) after fruit
set (marble size).
Harvest: Starts bearing from 3 - 4 years after planting. The tree flowers and produces fruits
almost all the year round, but there are three major flushes in June-July (Mrig Bahar),
September-October (Hast Bahar) and January – February (Ambi Bahar). Fruits of
September-October flowering (Hast Bahar) harvested during summer months are most
remunerative. The fruits mature in 5-6 months after flowering and are harvested when the
14colour just starts changing. Peak harvesting period is July-September and November-
January.
Post harvest handling
Harvested fruits are graded according to size and colour and packed in bamboo baskets or
wooden crates lined with green foliage. Treating the fruits with 4% wax emulsion followed by
pre-packing in 200 gauge polythene bags with 1 % ventilation improves the shelf life for
more than 10 days.
